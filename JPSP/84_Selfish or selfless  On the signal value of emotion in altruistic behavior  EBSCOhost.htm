These theories argue that even in the absence of material and reputational benefits, individuals reap utility from the feelings associated with doing good. In response to this normative view of altruism, this article examines the descriptive question of whether laypeople penalize emotional prosocial actors. Six studies find that emotion serves as a positive signal of moral character, despite the intrapsychic benefits associated with it. This is true when emotion motivates prosocial behavior (Studies 1, 2, 3, and 5) and when emotion is a positive outcome of prosocial behavior (i.e., “warm glow”; Studies 4, 5, and 6). Emotional actors are considered to be moral because people believe emotion provides an honest and direct signal that the actor feels a genuine concern for others. Consequently, prosocial actors who are motivated by the expectation of emotional rewards are judged differently than prosocial actors who are motivated by other benefits, such as reputational or material rewards (Study 6). These results suggest that laypeople do not view altruism as incompatible with all benefits to the self.

By practicing compassion, I get one hundred percent benefit, while the benefit to others may be fifty percent. (Dalai Lama, quoted in 
          Goleman, 2003)
        </blockquote></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Emotion plays a fundamental role in prosocial behavior. Although scholars debate the exact nature of it (
        Batson, 1991; 
        Cialdini et al., 1987), there is little doubt that emotion provides a motivating force that explains when and for whom human beings care and help (
        Batson, 1990; 
        Darwin, 1872/1965; 
        Davis, 1994; 
        de Waal, 1996; 
        Frank, 1988; 
        Hume, 1777/1960; 
        Loewenstein &amp; Small, 2007; 
        McDougall, 1908; 
        Slovic, 2007; 
        Smith, 1790/1976). Emotion is also a natural consequence of prosocial behavior. Helping others can lift people out of a negative mood (
        Cialdini et al., 1987), sustain a positive mood (
        Forest, Clark, Mills, &amp; Isen, 1979), and generally improve subjective well-being (
        Aknin, Sandstrom, Dunn, &amp; Norton, 2011; 
        Andreoni, 1990; 
        Diener &amp; Lucas, 2000; 
        Dunn, Aknin, &amp; Norton, 2008; 
        Harbaugh, 1998; 
        Lyubomirsky, Sheldon, &amp; Schkade, 2005; 
        Weinstein &amp; Ryan, 2010).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">However, the fact that people often feel good after helping calls into question the true motivation for their behavior. Altruism is characterized by a motivation to increase another person’s welfare and is presumed to be driven by a selfless concern for others (
        Batson, 1990; 
        Batson &amp; Powell, 2003; 
        Darwin, 1871; 
        Eisenberg &amp; Miller, 1987; 
        MacIntyre, 1967). Consistent with this conceptualization, there exists considerable empirical support demonstrating that individuals will incur a significant cost to the self in order to help others (
        Batson, 1991; 
        Camerer &amp; Thaler, 1995). Yet, even in anonymous settings in which individuals cannot reap material or social benefits, it is possible that good deeds are still driven by selfish desires. Rather than being motivated to reduce the suffering of others, individuals may instead be motivated by intrapsychic rewards, such as feeling good for having done a good deed (
        Andreoni, 1990) or experiencing relief from distress caused by witnessing suffering (
        Cialdini, Darby, &amp; Vincent, 1973; 
        Cialdini et al., 1987). The logic of altruism suggests that an individual’s intentions for engaging in prosocial behavior should be discounted when actors are motivated by the benefits that result from the behavior—be they material, social, or intrapsychic.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">As such, the debate in social psychology over whether people are truly altruistic focuses on the direction of emotion that people feel when engaging in prosocial behavior. Are their feelings directed toward themselves or toward those whom they are helping? Although some argue that emotion can genuinely be about others’ welfare, claiming that empathy triggers the altruistic motivation to help others in need (e.g., 
        Batson, 1987; 
        Batson, Duncan, Ackerman, Buckley, &amp; Birch, 1981; 
        Batson, Fultz, &amp; Schoenrade, 1987; 
        Batson, O’Quin, Fultz, Vanderplas, &amp; Isen, 1983; 
        Hoffman, 1976; 
        Krebs, 1975), others argue that emotion-driven prosocial behavior is necessarily at odds with true altruism. These scholars suggest that helping, when motivated by emotion, is selfish because emotional actors are motivated by intrapsychic rewards, rather than a desire to help others (
        Cialdini et al., 1973; 
        Cialdini et al., 1987).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Similar debates in philosophy and economics question the interpretation of emotion in altruism. 
        Bentham (1843/1948) and 
        Mill (1906) argued that morality is a function of reason and is thus incompatible with “passion,” and 
        Kant (1785/1959) argued that emotion was impure and only duty-based reasons reflected moral behavior. Economists are similarly skeptical that emotion-driven giving reflects genuine altruism; emotion is believed to represent a self-interested motive that provides an economically rational explanation for generous behavior. For instance, 
        Andreoni (1988) posited that “giving is motivated by many things other than altruism. Guilt, sympathy, an ethic for duty, a taste for fairness, or a desire for recognition may all influence an individual’s contribution to charity” (p. 57). In this way, both emotion-driven prosocial behavior and prosocial behavior that results in emotional benefits are considered self-gratifying, rather than truly altruistic.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In this paper, we investigate lay theories about the role of emotion in altruistic behavior. Although emotion has been depicted by scholars as inherent to as well as incongruous with altruism, little prior work has investigated how laypeople judge the moral character of prosocial actors as a function of their emotion. We propose that naive theories about the relationship between emotion and altruism run counter to psychological, philosophical, and economic theories that consider emotion to be selfish. To test this, we examine the signal value of emotion when it triggers prosocial behavior and when it is the consequence of prosocial behavior. We expect that in both cases (feeling emotion prior to helping and feeling emotion as a result of helping), judgments of an actor’s character will be a function of the actor’s emotional experience: The more emotion he (or she) feels, the more he will be judged as having high moral character. As a result, laypeople will view an emotional actor as altruistic, even though they recognize that an emotional actor reaps intrapsychic rewards.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Investigating how lay theories contrast with normative models is a fundamental tool for understanding intuitive psychological processes. Just as the findings from behavioral decision theory reveal psychological processes by showing that judgments about risk, probability, and utility violate normative standards of economics, it is important to understand when lay theories of moral judgment run counter to normative theories of morality, rather than reserving these questions for specialists and overlooking commonsense intuitions (e.g., 
        Knobe &amp; Nichols, 2008; 
        Monin, Pizarro, &amp; Beer, 2007). Although showing an inconsistency does not necessarily invalidate the normative models, it does provide insight into the processes that govern moral judgment (
        Baron, 2008). Ultimately, lay intuitions are the “heart of morality” (
        Guglielmo, Monroe, &amp; Malle, 2009), as they drive moral reasoning (
        Haidt, 2001) and can also guide behavior (e.g., 
        Candee &amp; Kohlberg, 1987; 
        Nucci, 2004).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Moreover, investigating lay theories of altruistic behavior is important for understanding how individuals ascribe moral character to others. Moral character is a predominant factor in social judgment and person perception (e.g., 
        Brambilla, Sacchi, Rusconi, Cherubini, &amp; Yzerbyt, 2012; 
        Goodwin, Piazza, &amp; Rozin, 2014; 
        Leach, Ellemers, &amp; Barreto, 2007), and it greatly influences interpersonal cooperation and trust (
        Alicke, 1992; 
        Darley &amp; Pittman, 2003; 
        Pizarro, Uhlmann, &amp; Bloom, 2003). Perceptions of moral traits, such as generosity, also influence the way in which individuals assign status and power to others (
        Flynn, 2003; 
        Flynn, Reagans, Amanatullah, &amp; Ames, 2006; 
        Hardy &amp; Van Vugt, 2006). Given the importance of moral character judgments, it is essential to understand who does and who does not get credit for their good deeds and what factors drive these inferences (e.g., 
        Critcher, Inbar, &amp; Pizzaro, 2013; 
        Inbar, Pizarro, &amp; Cushman, 2012; 
        Pizarro, Uhlmann, &amp; Salovey 2003).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In the subsequent sections, we review literature on lay theories of altruism, followed by literature on perceptions of emotion. We integrate and build on these two streams of research to generate our thesis about the signal value of emotion in altruistic behavior.</p><a id="psp-107-3-393-EJDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_14" title="Naive Theories of Altruism">Naive Theories of Altruism</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Previous work that examined naive theories of altruism has focused primarily on the norm of self-interest, finding that individuals generally regard prosocial behavior with suspicion. For example, individuals tend to assume that prosocial actors have personal investments in the causes they support (
        Miller, 1999; 
        Ratner &amp; Miller, 2001). Further, the more that an observer contemplates another person’s motives for good deeds, the more the observer is likely to believe that an individual was motivated by selfishness rather than genuine altruism (
        Critcher &amp; Dunning, 2011; see also 
        Fein, 1996).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Indeed, recent work on perceptions of altruism suggests that evidence of personal benefits is likely to lead to the discounting of prosocial behavior (
        Lin-Healy &amp; Small, 2012, 
        2013; 
        Newman &amp; Cain, 2014). For example, 
        Lin-Healy and Small (2013) found that the reflexive association between altruism and sacrifice is so strong that people grant less credit to those who benefit materially from good deeds, even when benefits are completely unforeseeable and outside of the actor’s control. Similarly, when companies perform good deeds, their actions are perceived as disingenuous if the campaign appears to have produced benefits for the company (
        Forehand &amp; Grier, 2003; 
        Yoon, Gürhan-Canli, &amp; Schwarz, 2006).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">This skepticism about prosocial acts also influences behavior. Individuals are motivated to convince themselves and others that their generosity is pure and that their good deeds are not motivated by selfish desires. For example, people behave more prosocially when doing so is painful and effortful and therefore costly to the self (
        Olivola &amp; Shafir, 2013). In this case, personal suffering acts as a costly signal of authentic prosocial motivation. Individuals will also adjust their behavior in public in order to appear as if they are not motivated by material rewards, including reducing the effort they put into prosocial tasks that provide financial benefits (
        Ariely, Bracha, &amp; Meier, 2009) or rejecting advertisements that link prosocial behavior with emotional benefits to the self (
        White &amp; Peloza, 2009). In sum, the desire to signal sacrifice and avoid personal benefit when behaving prosocially suggests that people generally believe that altruism is inconsistent with benefits to the self.
      </p><a id="psp-107-3-393-EIDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_19" title="The Signal Value of Emotion">The Signal Value of Emotion</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Although the research described above suggests that people are often skeptical about prosocial behavior and view benefits to the self as evidence of insincere motives, there is reason to believe that people may view emotional benefits less cynically. Building on prior work, we propose that emotion provides information about the sincerity of one’s underlying motives, which leads others to perceive emotional prosocial actors as altruistic.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In general, emotion provides an interpersonal signal of motives and behavioral intentions, and it therefore helps individuals understand each other and coordinate their interactions in meaningful ways (
        Frank, 1988; 
        Keltner &amp; Haidt, 1999; 
        Van Kleef, 2009). Because emotion is perceived as spontaneous and natural (
        Hochschild, 1983; 
        Tiedens, 2001), people believe that it is an untainted signal of an individual’s underlying state and is therefore more informative and credible than other forms of communication (e.g., 
        Newcombe &amp; Ashkanasy, 2002). For example, people often use an actor’s emotional display to make inferences about his traits and dispositions (e.g., 
        Harker &amp; Keltner, 2001; 
        Knutson, 1996), sincerity (
        Dasborough &amp; Ashkanasy, 2002), honesty (e.g., 
        Ekman, Friesen, &amp; O’Sullivan, 1988), and satisfaction in a relationship (e.g., 
        Carstensen, Gottman, &amp; Levenson, 1995).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Individuals also use others’ displayed emotion to deduce the intentions behind their behavior. For instance, if an actor displays positive affect when performing a certain behavior, individuals assume the action was intentional, whereas if an actor displays negative affect when performing a behavior, individuals assume the action was unintentional (
        Ames &amp; Johar, 2009). Similarly, facial expressions can provide honest signals of cooperative intent (
        Reed, Zeglen, &amp; Schmidt, 2012). These findings are consistent with a larger body of research demonstrating that certain contextual cues—such as the speed of a decision—are used to make inferences of underlying desires and motives, which in turn influence trait inferences (e.g., 
        Inbar et al., 2012; 
        Pizarro, Uhlmann, &amp; Salovey, 2003; 
        Read, Jones, &amp; Miller, 1990; 
        Reeder, Kumar, Hesson-McInnis, &amp; Trafimow, 2002). Building on these findings, we suggest that emotion, both as an antecedent and as a consequence of prosocial behavior, signals information about an actor’s true motives and character. Specifically, the level of emotion displayed by an actor provides information about the degree to which he or she truly cares.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Not only does emotion contain positive signal value, but a lack of emotion also carries negative stigma. Suppressing emotion or being unemotional can generate suspicion (
        Butler et al., 2003; 
        Collins &amp; Miller, 1994) and can reflect poorly on individuals even if they take a morally superior action (
        Uhlmann, Zhu, &amp; Tannenbaum, 2013). Furthermore, violating emotional norms—such as not displaying the expected or appropriate emotional reaction—can lead to moral outrage (
        Szczurek, Monin, &amp; Gross, 2012). Prosocial behavior may represent one context for which emotion is normatively appropriate. Society teaches children at a young age to be sympathetic toward others, and professional schools provide the same advice to managers (e.g., 
        Salovey &amp; Mayer, 1989). Politicians on both sides attempt to portray themselves as emotionally attuned to the needs of constituents, with the expectation that such signals (from “liberal sympathy” to “compassionate conservatism”) sway voters. Thus, emotion may be regarded as the natural or correct response in many relational contexts.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We theorize that emotion that motivates prosocial behavior and emotional benefits that result from prosocial behavior each serve as positive signals of moral character. Just as individuals make inferences about others’ personality traits and intentions from their emotions (
        Ekman, Friesen, &amp; Ellsworth, 1972; 
        Fridlund, 1994; 
        Frijda, 1986; 
        Parkinson, 1996; 
        Van Kleef, 2009), in the context of prosocial behavior, we suggest, emotion influences judgments of moral character and corresponding motive inferences. Unlike previous work that varies the valence of emotion (
        Ames &amp; Johar, 2009), our studies focus on feelings that have been characterized as ulterior motives and as evidence for impurity in the altruism debate. That is, we compare empathy and distress as emotions that motivate good deeds (e.g., 
        Batson et al., 1983) and examine how each is viewed in the eyes of others. In addition, we examine whether experiencing emotional benefits (i.e., a “warm glow”; 
        Andreoni, 1990) signifies that an actor was motivated by selfishness. We predict in each case that emotion signals authentic concern for others, which leads to higher perceived moral character.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">To summarize, we make three key predictions. First, when a donor’s emotion toward a cause motivates his prosocial action, laypeople will infer that he genuinely cares about the cause. We expect this inference to hold, even when the emotion is described as distress, an emotion with self-focused connotations. As a result, more emotional donors will be judged to be more moral than those who are less emotional.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Second, individuals will expect that those who feel emotional toward a cause will receive emotional benefits as a result of performing a good deed. In other words, feeling emotional toward a cause simultaneously leads to inferences about altruistic motivation and to inferences about intrapsychic rewards that result from doing good. This union of judgments does not concur with the normative view that pure altruism cannot be self-gratifying.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Third, we predict that when the level of emotional benefits is specified, rather than the level of emotion toward a cause, emotion will have a similar positive effect on judgments of authentic prosocial motivation and moral character. When a donor receives, or expects to receive, emotional benefits as a consequence of his prosocial actions, individuals will infer that the donor was motivated by an authentic concern for others and, thus, will perceive him as being moral. In other words, feeling good as a result of doing good signals that the prosocial actor valued the act of helping others. Thus, we theorize a causal relationship between emotional benefits and judgments of moral character based on the same underlying mechanism: Emotion signals an authentic concern for others.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Note that authentic prosocial motivation is related to, but distinct from, intrinsic motivation. Authentic prosocial motivation is characterized by both authenticity—acting in a way that is consistent with one’s internal feeling (
        Kernis &amp; Goldman, 2006; 
        Le &amp; Impett, 2013; 
        Sheldon, Ryan, Rawsthorne, &amp; Ilardi, 1997)—and true concern for others (
        Batson &amp; Powell, 2003). Alternatively, intrinsic motivation is characterized as engaging in an activity for the self because it is inherently enjoyable or satisfying (
        Ryan &amp; Deci, 2000). For example, in the domain of education, a student is intrinsically motivated if he enjoys or finds personal pleasure in learning. The crux of authentic prosocial motivation is not the satisfaction derived from the act but rather the genuine desire to help others. In addition, the construct of intrinsic motivation is typically contrasted to extrinsic motivation, for which an external reward is theorized to crowd out or reduce the pleasure inherent in an activity. Our theorizing and operationalization hold constant any extrinsic benefits.
      </p><a id="psp-107-3-393-EHDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_30" title="Overview of Current Research">Overview of Current Research</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">To reiterate, we predict that the greater emotion a prosocial actor feels, the more moral he or she will be perceived. In the eyes of others, emotional prosocial actors are authentically generous and also reap emotional benefits, a combination of judgments that conflicts with the normative view that altruism is incompatible with any benefits to the actor.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Six studies test these predictions, employing a diverse set of stimuli that vary whether emotion is self-reported by the actor or is purportedly objective information. The first three studies examine perceptions of emotion that motivates prosocial behavior. Study 1 investigates a wide range of emotion levels in order to explore the causal relationships between emotion that motivates prosocial behavior and judgments of (a) moral character, (b) altruistic motivation, and (c) emotional benefits. This study provides initial evidence that judgments of emotional benefits and moral character are not incongruous. Study 2 then examines how the description of the actor’s emotion (sympathy or distress) affects perceptions of moral character. Study 3 contrasts character inferences made about emotion that motivates prosocial behavior with emotion that does not motivate prosocial behavior.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The next three studies employ manipulations of emotional benefits. These studies examine perceptions of prosocial actors who feel emotion (i.e., happiness) in response to doing good deeds. Study 4 conceptually replicates Study 1, except participants learn about the extent to which a donor experienced emotional benefits across a wide range of emotion levels. Study 5 independently manipulates emotion that motivates prosocial behavior and emotional benefits that result from it, to further tease apart how each of these, controlling for the other, influences judgments of moral character. Finally, Study 6 documents a causal relationship between the expectation of emotional benefits and moral character. This study demonstrates that in the context of prosocial behavior, emotional benefits are different from other types of rewards, namely, reputational and material rewards.</p><a id="psp-107-3-393-EGDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_35" title="Study 1">Study 1</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Study 1 tests whether the level of emotion a donor feels toward a cause affects perceptions of moral character, emotional benefits, and related judgments.

In this study and across all our studies, we included all participants in our analysis and made no exclusions (

        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">At the beginning of the study, participants read that the researchers had previously administered a survey to recent donors to the African Children’s Fund. Participants then viewed a screenshot of one such survey filled out by a donor and provided their judgments of the donor. Although the donor survey was ostensibly real, it was in fact fictitious.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Appendix A includes an example of the stimuli that was presented to participants. All information in the fictitious donor survey was the same across all conditions except for the response to the question “When you think about children in Africa, how emotional do you feel?” Participants were randomly assigned to view one survey that had one of the five possible responses to that question (not at all emotional, slightly emotional, moderately emotional, very emotional, or extremely emotional) or to a survey that omitted the question about emotion altogether. This last condition is referred to as the no-information condition. The purpose of the no-information condition was to examine inferences people make about prosocial actors in the absence of explicit information relating to emotion.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">So that the no-information condition would not appear completely devoid of content, the fictitious donor survey also included an open-ended question: “Please tell us more about why you donated to the African Children’s Fund.” In all conditions, the donor responded, “I recently read an article in the newspaper about how many children are hungry in Africa.”</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Measures</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">All of the measures described below refer to judgments made by participants about the donor’s character, motivation, and feelings.

Participants rated all items on 7-point Likert scales ranging from 1 (
              <em>Not at all</em>) to 7 (

              Wojciszke, Bazinska, &amp; Jaworski, 1998) but is more focused on altruism-relevant traits than these previous scales (which typically also include altruism-irrelevant traits that are not central to our theory, such as honest, righteous, and tolerant).

Given this distinction, participants rated the extent to which they thought the donor felt distress, discomfort, sympathy, and compassion when donating (adapted from 
              Batson et al., 1983). The average of distress and discomfort serve as the measure of perceived distress,

Using bootstrap analyses (
            Hayes, Preacher, &amp; Myers, 2011; 
            MacKinnon, Fairchild, &amp; Fritz, 2007), we find that the 95% bias-corrected confidence interval for the size of the indirect effect excluded zero (indirect effect = 0.13, 
            <em>SE</em> = 0.04; 95% CI [0.06, 0.20]), such that increasing the level of emotion increases perceived authentic prosocial motivation (

In other words, participants do not view emotional benefits as selfish per se. Rather, donors who are perceived as feeling good as a result of giving are also the ones who are considered more moral.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In addition, as can been seen in 
          Figures 1 and 
          2, in the absence of any emotion-relevant information (no-information condition), participants infer that donors do experience emotion and thus perceive them to be of similar moral character to those who report feeling emotion and of higher moral character than those who report feeling no emotion. These findings suggest that people view emotion as a natural part of prosocial behavior and that those who do not express emotion are penalized.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Yet, the effects are not merely due to the fact that unemotional donors are penalized for an abnormal reaction.

However, this effect may depend on the specific emotion that motivates a donor’s behavior. The type of emotion was not specified in Study 1, and participants inferred both empathy and distress from our manipulation, albeit greater empathy than distress. It is possible that participants would judge a prosocial actor as less moral when distress is emphasized, because distress is presumed to reflect the selfish motive to reap emotional benefits. To test this, the next study varies whether a donor is motivated by other-focused empathy or by self-focused distress.</p><a id="psp-107-3-393-EFDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_75" title="Study 2">Study 2</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">As discussed above, previous work reveals two distinct emotions that motivate prosocial behavior: empathy and distress. Empathy is defined as other-focused (i.e., directed toward the beneficiaries of one’s good deeds), whereas distress is defined as self-focused (i.e., evoking an “egoistic motivation to reduce one’s own aversive arousal”; 
        Batson et al., 1987, p. 19). Distress is theorized to be selfish, because it is associated with a desire to relieve personal discomfort rather than a desire to help others.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Study 2 investigates whether emotion that is specified as either empathy or distress differentially affects perceptions of moral character. This permits an examination of whether lay beliefs about the nature of personal distress concur with psychological theories that position distress as selfish.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We hypothesize that greater emotion will increase perceptions of moral character, regardless of whether the emotion is described as empathy or distress. Although we expect distress to be recognized as self-focused, we also expect it to signal authentic prosocial motivation. Thus, we predict that high levels of distress will increase perceptions of moral character and authentic prosocial motivation because people will not view emotional self-focus as incompatible with a genuine desire to help others.</p><a id="psp-107-3-393-ECFDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Three hundred fifty-one individuals (35% female; mean age = 28 years) participated in an online survey via Amazon.com’s Mechanical Turk in exchange for payment.

Unlike Study 1, in which the level of emotion was self-reported by the target donor, in Study 2, the reported GSR level served as a seemingly objective measure of the target’s emotion. This helps rule out the possibility that participants’ perceptions are sensitive to the way in which donors describe their feelings, rather than to donors’ actual feelings. Last, the GSR record explicitly stated that the target donated $5 in all conditions to control for inferences about the magnitude of donation across conditions.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Participants were randomly assigned to one of four conditions in a 2 (emotion type: sympathy vs. distress) × 2 (emotion level: high vs. low) between-subjects design. Across all conditions, participants learned that the GSR instrument measured the electrical conductance of the skin. Whereas the actual GSR is not sensitive to the specific nature of the emotional response, participants in this study were led to believe that it measures a specific emotion. Half of the participants read that the GSR measured sympathy, and the other half read that the GSR measured distress.
          <a id="b-fn3"> </a><sup /> Sympathy was described as “the feeling of sensitivity and concern for others,” and distress was described as “the feeling of personal uneasiness and discomfort” (
          Batson et al., 1983, 
          1987). To rule out the possibility of an effect being driven by a negative reaction toward a donor without any emotion, this study compared a high level and a low level of emotion (rather than no emotion), as indicated on the GSR record of the donor.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">After viewing the record of the fictitious donor, participants answered the same set of questions as in Study 1 (each scale α &gt; .77), plus two new measures to examine whether participants interpreted sympathy as other-focused and distress as self-focused, as intended. Specifically, to capture other-focus, participants answered the question, “To what extent was the donor thinking about others?”</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Participants were also asked, “To what extent was the donor thinking about him/herself?” This item loaded with one item from the previous study (“To what extent did the donor donate to make him/herself feel better?”), and these two items were combined to create a measure of self-focus, 
          <em>r</em>(351) = .42, 
          <em>p</em> &lt; .001. This conceptualization of self-focus is consistent with theories that characterize distress as an emotion that activates the selfish motive to help others in order to improve one’s own emotional state, rather than out of true concern for others (e.g., 
          Batson, 1987).
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">It is important to note that other-focus and self-focus were positively, but insignificantly, correlated,

            <em>SE</em> = 0.06; 95% CI [0.21, 0.43]). Specifically, increasing the level of emotion increases perceived authenticity (
            <em>a</em> = 0.69), which in turn increases perceptions of moral character (
            <em>b</em> = 0.46). Once we include authenticity in the model, the relationship between emotion level and moral character decreases significantly (

This is true regardless of whether the donor’s emotion is described as sympathy or as distress. We find evidence of this relationship when the level of emotion is obtained from a seemingly objective and nonfakeable measure of the target’s emotion (i.e., a galvanic skin response score).</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Past research characterizes distress as a self-focused emotional response to others in need and thus, as not purely altruistic (
          Batson, 1987; 
          Batson et al., 1981; 
          Cialdini et al., 1973, 
          1987). However, this study finds that high distress is not penalized in the eyes of others. Although donors high in distress are judged to be significantly more self-focused than donors who are low in distress (i.e., they are perceived as thinking about themselves and as motivated by emotional benefits), high distress still signals stronger moral character. This is likely because high-distress donors are presumed to feel sympathy as well and to be focused on others in addition to themselves. That is, when evaluating emotion in the context of prosocial behavior, people do not view self-focus as incompatible with other-focus.

Study 3 examines whether emotion signals moral character even when it fails to promote prosocial behavior. We expect that when individuals choose not to engage in prosocial behavior, emotion level will no longer predict moral character. To test this hypothesis, Study 3 independently manipulates the actor’s level of distress and the actor’s behavior.</p><a id="psp-107-3-393-ECEDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Four hundred seventy individuals (35% female; mean age = 28 years) participated in an online survey via Amazon.com’s Mechanical Turk in exchange for payment.

The materials in Study 3 were similar to those used in Study 2, with two notable changes. First, the GSR was always described as measuring distress, “the feeling of personal uneasiness and discomfort.” We used distress, rather than sympathy, because it is more plausible that distress would motivate either prosocial or self-interested behavior (
          Batson et al., 1987).
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Second, all participants were informed that people in the previous study earned a $2 bonus for their participation and had the choice of either donating the $2 bonus to the African Children’s Fund or receiving the bonus in the form of a $2 iTunes gift card.

In the donation and gift card conditions, participants viewed the target’s “Donation Summary,” which indicated that the target opted for either the $2 donation or the $2 iTunes gift card. In the no-information condition, participants learned no further information about the bonus or the target’s behavior. The purpose of the no-information condition was to examine the signal value of distress when there is uncertainty about a target’s subsequent behavior.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">After viewing the record of the fictitious donor, participants provided judgments of moral character (α = .94) and inferred emotion type (empathy and distress, each 
          <em>r</em> &gt; .83), using the same items as Studies 1 and 2. We did not collect authentic prosocial motivation or emotional benefits measures in this study because the items referred to a donation action and thus would not make sense in the no-information and gift card conditions. However, we added an additional item that measured perceived likelihood of donating (“How likely is it that this person donated money to the African Children’s Fund?” 1 = 
          <em>Not at all likely</em> to 7 = 
          <em>Extremely likely</em>). This item was used to examine whether emotional targets are perceived as more likely to donate in the absence of explicit information about their prosocial behavior (i.e., in the no-information condition).

Using bootstrap analyses, we find that the 95% bias-corrected confidence interval for the size of the indirect effect excluded zero (indirect effect = 0.15, 
            <em>SE</em> = 0.03; 95% CI [0.10, 0.22]), such that increasing the level of emotional benefits increases perceived authenticity (
            <em>a</em> = 0.23, 
            <em>p</em> &lt; .001), which in turn increases perceptions of moral character (
            <em>b</em> = 0.68, 
            <em>p</em> &lt; .001). Once we include authenticity in the model, the relationship between emotional benefits and moral character becomes less significant (

            <em>c′</em> = .05, 
            <em>p</em> = .05). This suggests that the greater emotional benefits a donor receives, the more the donor is perceived as having high moral character because his motivation appears more authentically directed toward others.

Just as emotion that motivates prosocial behavior signals moral character, so does emotion that follows from prosocial behavior. Donors who experience intrapsychic rewards (i.e., “warm, positive feelings” as a result of donating) are not perceived as selfish. Rather, emotional benefits signal authentic prosocial motivation and moral character. Although prior work has documented a robust negative relationship between personal benefits and perceptions of altruism (e.g., 
          Lin-Healy &amp; Small, 2013; 
          Newman &amp; Cain, 2014), emotional benefits appear to defy this relationship. This suggests that emotional benefits lead to different inferences than material benefits in the context of altruistic behavior, which we test directly in our final study.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Furthermore, in the absence of any emotion-relevant information (no-information condition), participants infer that donors do experience emotional benefits. These findings suggest that people view emotional benefits as a natural part of prosocial behavior and penalize those who do not feel them.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">As was found in Study 1, donors who report feeling no emotion at all—in this case, no warm, positive feeling—were perceived as having weaker moral character than donors in the no-information condition. However, the results are not driven exclusively by this condition. The positive linear trend between emotional benefits and moral character is significant even when the not-at-all condition is removed from the analysis, β = .20,

However, in each of the previous studies, we manipulate only one of these two categories of emotion and find that people naturally infer one from the other. Therefore, we cannot know the independent casual effect of each, holding constant the other. In Study 5, we disentangle distress and emotional benefits by manipulating them orthogonally. Consistent with Studies 2 and 3, distress is utilized to describe the emotion that motivates prosocial behavior.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In addition to the orthogonal manipulation of distress and emotional benefits, Study 5 attempts to control for the target’s expectation of an intrapsychic reward. Scholars presume that distress motivates prosocial behavior because distressed individuals are hoping to relieve their negative state. In this study, we hold expected intrapsychic benefits constant and examine if distress and emotional benefits still positively and independently signal moral character.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Finally, Study 5 employs a different type of stimuli from the previous studies. Participants read a third-person scenario in which the emotional state of the individual is described as if it were an objective fact.

Most important, this study independently manipulates emotion as a driver of prosocial behavior (i.e., distress) and emotion as a consequence (i.e., warm glow).

We test whether individuals perceive prosocial actors who anticipate these emotional rewards as more moral than those who do not expect such rewards.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In addition, Study 6 examines whether the relationship between emotional benefits and moral character is unique by comparing emotional benefits to other types of benefits, such as material or reputational rewards.

In the reputational benefits conditions, participants learned that the individual either expected to receive public recognition for his donation because his name would appear in the local newspaper or did not expect to receive public recognition because his donation was anonymous.

This is true across a range of levels of emotion benefits (Study 4) and is independent of the level of emotion the donor feels toward the cause (Study 5). In Study 6, we document a causal relationship between the expectation of emotional benefits and moral character judgments; unlike other benefits, anticipating emotional benefits increases perceptions of authentic prosocial motivation and moral character.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">These results are robust across studies that differ in how an actor’s emotion is conveyed and portrayed. In Studies 1 and 4, emotion was self-reported by the actor. In Studies 2 and 3, a galvanic skin response ostensibly captured the actor’s true level of either sympathy or distress. In Studies 5 and 6, the emotional state of the actor was described in an objective narrative account.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In addition, the description of the levels of emotion varied across studies. In Study 1, the level of emotion felt toward a cause ranged from “not at all” to “extremely,” as did the range of emotional benefits in Study 4. Although it was expected and found that a completely unfeeling prosocial actor is penalized, this condition alone cannot explain our findings: In both Studies 1 and 4, there remained a positive linear trend between emotion level and judged moral character, even when the lowest emotion level (“not at all” emotional) was omitted from the analyses. Studies 2, 3, 5, and 6 provide further evidence that the results are not driven solely by reactions toward a wholly unemotional donor by introducing new control conditions. In Studies 2 and 3, the level of emotion was designated as either high or low, and in Studies 5 and 6, the donor’s mood was described as being unaffected by donating, rather than explicitly lacking emotion.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The present research suggests that people may not always be skeptical about altruism. Although a large body of research has argued that emotional motivation and emotional benefits are inconsistent with pure altruism (e.g., 
        Andreoni, 1990; 
        Cialdini et al., 1973, 
        1987), we find that naive theories reflect the opposite. The fact that a prosocial actor is emotional could be interpreted as genuine other-focused empathy or as self-focused distress. Previous work on the norm of self-interest and lay beliefs of altruism (e.g., 
        Critcher &amp; Dunning, 2011; 
        Miller, 1999) suggests that such signals will be interpreted with skepticism, leading people to believe that emotion reflects selfishness. However, the present research shows that people generally infer that prosocial actors are empathic and genuinely motivated to help the cause in question. Even when lacking information about a prosocial actor’s emotional state, when the emotion is described as self-focused distress, and when the donor explicitly expects emotional rewards, people still view the actor favorably.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">These findings indicate that emotional benefits are a special kind of benefit; unlike other personal benefits, emotional benefits do not undermine perceptions of altruism. Whereas prior work found that personal benefits such as monetary rewards (e.g., 
        Lin-Healy &amp; Small, 2013) or a positive reputation (e.g., 
        Berman et al., 2014; 
        Yoon et al., 2006) trigger suspicion about a prosocial actor’s motives, emotional benefits trigger the opposite. Laypeople hold the intuition that emotion and altruism are positively related. Just as people utilize their own emotional reactions to inform moral judgments (
        Greene &amp; Haidt, 2002; 
        Greene, Morelli, Lowenberg, Nystrom, &amp; Cohen, 2008; 
        Haidt, 2001), they also view others’ emotion as a valid signal of moral character. As originally posited by Adam 
        Smith (1790/1976) in 
        <em>The Theory of Moral Sentiments,</em> moral sentiments (i.e., emotion) serve as discernible cues that allow outsiders to determine a person’s true intentions (see also 
        Darwin, 1872/1965; 
        Frank, 1988).
      </p><a id="psp-107-3-393-EAADA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Limitations and Future Directions</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Many questions remain about how people interpret the emotional reactions of others when they behave prosocially. Although the present results suggest that emotional prosocial actors are perceived as more altruistic, they may be judged more negatively along other dimensions. For instance, people may view emotional actors as meaning well but not acting in ways that have as much impact as those whose actions are based purely on reason. Future research can examine how people make inferences about prosocial actors motivated by emotion compared to prosocial actors motivated by reason. Although moral character inferences are highly connected to inferences about motives, judgments about competence depend on beliefs about one’s ability to achieve those motives (
          Wojciszke, 1994) or, in the prosocial domain, on one’s ability to make an impact. The evidence herein finds that emotion signals moral character. However, reason-based motives—such as duty or utilitarianism—may be a stronger signal of competence, and emotion may signal low competence. Such competence judgments might be sensible, given that aid allocation decisions are often distorted by emotion (e.g., 
          Baron, 1993; 
          Singer, 2009; 
          Small, Loewenstein, &amp; Slovic, 2007).
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Prior research has also found that emotion, particularly happiness, signals warmth (
          Knutson, 1996). As a result, it is possible that the present findings are driven by perceptions of warmth rather than moral character per se. However, when warmth-related traits (sincere, good, nice; e.g., 
          Fiske, Cuddy, Glick, &amp; Xu, 2002) are removed from our scale of moral character, the results do not change. Across all studies, more emotional prosocial actors are perceived as more moral when moral character is measured on a scale consisting of only the six purely moral traits (altruistic, pure, and moral; selfish, impure, and immoral—reverse scored; all 
          <em>p</em>s &lt; .01).
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Future research could also examine if the lay theories investigated in the present research shape people’s attempts to signal to others that they are altruistic. If the connection between emotion and moral character is strong enough, it might encourage people to fake emotion to appear more altruistic. If this were the case, it would be beneficial to understand whether observers are able to detect real versus false emotion and whether they would discount altruistic behavior associated with faked sentiments. Evidence finds that people can distinguish between true and posed smiles (e.g., 
          Frank, Ekman, &amp; Friesen 1993); however, less is known about people’s ability to detect other faked emotions, such as empathy.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Another extension would be to explore the signaling power of emotion in domains other than charity donations and volunteering. We suspect that the link between emotion and authentic prosocial motivation applies to a broader class of behaviors in which people have to make inferences about others’ underlying motives. For example, paying someone a compliment or doing someone a favor could be interpreted as a genuine desire to praise or help, or as a behavior motivated by selfish expectations of reciprocity. Expressions of emotion in the context of bargaining, or even marriage, can help individuals signal that they can be trusted and are committed (
          Frank, 1988; 
          Reed et al., 2012). Similarly, the signal value of emotion might be relevant to leaders (e.g., politicians or executives) who want to demonstrate an honest concern for their constituents.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">A final extension of this work lies in the possibility for promoting prosocial behavior within the constraints of human limitations. Previous research finds that material benefits from doing good decrease perceptions of moral character (
          Lin-Healy &amp; Small, 2013; 
          Newman &amp; Cain, 2014) and that awareness of selfish incentives can crowd out prosocial behavior (
          Ariely et al., 2009). However, emotional benefits may be the one selfish benefit that does not diminish character judgments. In the epigraph that opens this paper, the Dalai Lama explicitly admits that his charitable acts produce emotional benefits. This could be considered a “win-win” situation; both the actor and the targets benefit from the prosocial action. Acknowledging that it is still charitable to feel good about doing good could encourage more people to give, resulting in the creation of more charitable behavior overall.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">By uncovering the power of emotion in signaling moral character, the present research offers novel insights into lay theories of altruism. Normative theories suggest that emotional benefits undermine the purity of a prosocial act. The present research explores not what emotional benefits should signal but rather what they do signal. In doing so, we provide a contradictory descriptive account of the relationship between emotion and altruism: Emotion signals moral character.</p><a id="psp-107-3-393-R" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_223" title="Footnotes">Footnotes</a></span><a id="fn1" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><sup>1</sup> In all studies, there was one additional exploratory measure.
