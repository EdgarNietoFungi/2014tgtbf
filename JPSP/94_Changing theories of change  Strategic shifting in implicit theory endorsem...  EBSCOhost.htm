These relatively chronic theories can be experimentally altered, and can be affected by parent or teacher feedback. Little is known about whether people might selectively shift their implicit beliefs in response to salient situational goals. We predicted that, when motivated to reach a desired conclusion, people might subtly shift their implicit theories of change and stability to garner supporting evidence for their desired position. Any motivated context in which a particular lay theory would help people to reach a preferred directional conclusion could elicit shifts in theory endorsement. We examine a variety of motivated situational contexts across 7 studies, finding that people’s theories of change shifted in line with goals to protect self and liked others and to cast aspersions on disliked others. Studies 1–3 demonstrate how people regulate their implicit theories to manage self-view by more strongly endorsing an incremental theory after threatening performance feedback or memories of failure. Studies 4–6 revealed that people regulate the implicit theories they hold about favored and reviled political candidates, endorsing an incremental theory to forgive preferred candidates for past gaffes but leaning toward an entity theory to ensure past failings “stick” to opponents. Finally, in Study 7, people who were most threatened by a previously convicted child sex offender (i.e., parents reading about the offender moving to their neighborhood) gravitated most to the entity view that others do not change. Although chronic implicit theories are undoubtedly meaningful, this research reveals a previously unexplored source of fluidity by highlighting the active role people play in managing their implicit theories in response to goals.

          <i>Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland</i></blockquote></p>Ain’t never changed, this is Jay every day(“I never change!”)I never change, this is Jay every day(“I never change!”)<p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Western culture is replete with sayings, proverbs, and song lyrics that capture seemingly divergent beliefs about change and stability. “A leopard cannot change its spots;” yet, you can always “turn over a new leaf.” Alicia Keys sings about a “brand new me,” and Bob Dylan’s times were perpetually a-changin’. Conversely, Bob Seger insists that he is “like a rock,” and Garth Brooks wants the world to know “that it will not change me.” Notions about both change and stability are enmeshed in people’s understanding of themselves and the world around them; people often see the truth in, and endorse, both viewpoints. Indeed, Western culture presents mixed messages about the desirability of change and stability. On one hand, being “steadfast and true” is as important a virtue as “changing with the times.” On the other hand, stability can be seen as a sign of stubbornness or stagnation, and change can be construed as an indicator of unpredictability or “flip-flopping.”</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Beliefs about both change and stability are prevalent culturally and evidence suggests that people have knowledge of and access to both beliefs (
        Poon &amp; Koehler, 2006). That said, previous research suggests that people tend to chronically endorse one perspective over the other. People who hold incremental theories view traits and abilities as malleable and changeable with effort and time, whereas people who hold entity theories view these same dimensions as relatively fixed, unalterable aspects of a person (
        Dweck &amp; Leggett, 1988). Although these beliefs are measured on a continuous scale, two dichotomous theories (entity and incremental) are usually described, reflecting relatively stronger endorsement of one or the other perspective. For the sake of brevity, we sometimes refer to these dichotomous implicit theories, but do so while recognizing the continuous nature of the beliefs.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Research on implicit theories of stability and change (
        Dweck, Chiu, &amp; Hong, 1995a; 
        Dweck &amp; Leggett, 1988; 
        Hong, Chiu, Dweck, Lin, &amp; Wan, 1999) suggests that these theories function like knowledge structures (
        Chiu, Hong, &amp; Dweck, 1997; 
        Dweck, Hong, &amp; Chiu, 1993; 
        Plaks, Levy, &amp; Dweck, 2009) such that people regularly lean toward using one theory over the other as a lens through which they interpret themselves and the world around them. Implicit theories can be affected by situational influences and feedback: For example, implicit theories of intelligence are shaped by the type of praise that teachers and parents offer in response to the student’s achievements (
        Mueller &amp; Dweck, 1998) and the attitudes that important others express about intelligence (
        Good, Rattan, &amp; Dweck, 2012). Implicit theories remain stable over time in the absence of an event or manipulation that leads students to reflect upon and revise their view (e.g., 
        Blackwell, Trzesniewski, &amp; Dweck, 2007; 
        Dweck, Chiu, &amp; Hong, 1995a). However, experimental techniques and, more recently, educational interventions have been successfully used to change students’ theories by leading them to consider evidence for either a fixed or malleable view of intelligence (e.g., 
        Aronson, Fried, &amp; Good, 2002; 
        Blackwell et al., 2007; 
        Hong et al., 1999; 
        Miller et al., 2012; 
        Molden, Plaks, &amp; Dweck, 2006; 
        Plaks &amp; Stecher, 2007; 
        Plaks, Stroessner, Dweck, &amp; Sherman, 2001). A host of studies has shown that these theories can be a powerful determinant of people’s attributions (
        Levy, Stroessner, &amp; Dweck, 1998), goals (
        Dweck et al., 1995a), responses to failure (
        Hong et al., 1999) and many other outcomes (
        Burnette &amp; Finkel, 2012; 
        Chiu et al., 1997; 
        Chiu, Dweck, Tong, &amp; Fu, 1997; 
        Halperin, Russell, Trzesniewski, Gross, &amp; Dweck, 2011; 
        Kammrath &amp; Dweck, 2006; 
        Nussbaum &amp; Dweck, 2008).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Although past research certainly demonstrates that implicit theories can shift in response to external situational forces (anything from rather subtle feedback from others to explicit educational interventions), little is known about how people might actively regulate their own endorsement of these theories in response to situational goals. We propose that people’s theories of change and stability also change in motivated ways. People often face situations where they must make judgments about the temporally extended self or others (
        Peetz &amp; Wilson, 2008). They must consider information about past performance, attributes, or behavior and determine how relevant it is to their present appraisals or future expectations for that individual. However, determining the relevance of past information to present or future judgments is often ambiguous, and people may not always be motivated only by accuracy goals. In cases where people are motivated to reach a particular conclusion about how the past pertains to the present or future, they may wish to either emphasize or downplay its relevance (
        Peetz &amp; Wilson, 2014; 
        Ross &amp; Wilson, 2002). For instance, an individual might prefer to believe that a failure does not represent an enduring deficit in his or her ability: in this instance, endorsing an implicit theory of malleability helps to support their desired conclusion. In contrast, endorsing a theory of stability after success might be gratifying because it holds the promise of continued triumph in the future.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">This perspective is in line with classic theory and research on motivated reasoning (
        Kunda, 1990). Kunda eloquently argued that the mechanism underlying motivated reasoning is the differential recruitment of cognitive processes, representations, and beliefs. Specifically, in some cases people are motivated to simply reason the most accurate conclusion given the evidence, but in many cases they are motivated to reach a particular, directional conclusion. Despite what they want to believe, however, people are not typically free to reach whatever conclusion they desire simply because they prefer it—they make an attempt at the appearance of objectivity (
        Pyszczynski &amp; Greenberg, 1987) by searching memory and constructing beliefs that would support that view. Past research demonstrates that people will adjust or even jettison a prior conviction when a new attitude or belief supports their desired conclusions (e.g., 
        Jost, Pelham, Sheldon, &amp; Sullivan, 2003; 
        Schumaker &amp; Slep, 2004; 
        Skitka, Bauman, &amp; Mullen, 2008; 
        Skitka &amp; Mullen, 2008; 
        Tesser, 2001). For example, after reading about successful or unsuccessful targets who shared some attributes with themselves, people shifted their causal theories about what attributes led to marital and academic success to correspond with the attributes they personally possessed (
        Kunda, 1987).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Might people creatively reinterpret their views on the stability or malleability of personal attributes to recruit evidence in favor of their desired conclusion? As discussed at outset, it seems likely that people have access to both implicit theories. Supporting this view, 
        Poon and Koehler (2006) have argued that implicit theories can be understood from a knowledge-activation framework: people have concurrent knowledge consistent with both change and stability, and that their dominant implicit theory at any given time depends on what knowledge has been primed. They demonstrated that when prompted to explain either stable or changeable behavior (e.g., the story of an individual who showed marked personality stability through life, or marked change), participants were able to generate explanations consistent with the relevant implicit theory. Participants were also able to generate examples supporting proverbs reflecting either entity beliefs (e.g., “can’t teach an old dog new tricks”) or incremental beliefs (e.g., “experience is the best teacher”).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We build on 
        Poon and Koehler’s (2006) perspective that people have knowledge of both implicit theories available to them, and 
        Kunda’s (1990) theorizing that people will change their attitudes as much as reasonably possible, constrained by their initial position. We go further, however, to say that people might strategically gravitate toward the implicit theory that best suits their current goals, but will not shift their theories in the absence of such goals. Over seven studies, we test the hypothesis that implicit theories of stability and change are more sensitive to motivational influences than previously demonstrated. We contend that people shift their implicit theories in ways that allow them to support motivated directional conclusions about themselves and about liked and disliked others. We do not predict wholesale jumps from one end of the continuum to the other. Rather, we predict small but systematic and meaningful movement from one’s chronic implicit theory toward the implicit theory that will be most likely to support their goals in a given situation.
      </p><a id="psp-107-4-597-EJDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_17" title="Malleability of Implicit Theories">Malleability of Implicit Theories</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">When are people motivated to reach directional conclusions? We suggest that people might wish to arrive at a particular conclusion any time a relevant goal is activated—whether it is to regulate views of self or someone else, across multiple domains and a variety of contexts. Consistent with recent theorizing about essential similarities across many motivated responses to goals and threats (
        Jonas et al., 2014; 
        Proulx &amp; Heine, 2010; 
        Tesser, 2001), we do not focus on a specific reason why people are motivated to reach a desired conclusion but rather sample from a range of contexts where people are motivated by a particular conclusion about the self (e.g., 
        Baumeister, 1998; 
        Higgins, 1996; 
        Sedikides, 1993) or others (
        Klein &amp; Kunda, 1992; 
        Skitka, Bauman, &amp; Mullen, 2008). These predictions should apply equally to motivated conclusions about the self or others. For instance, if Erika receives disappointing feedback on an intelligence test, she might be especially motivated to view intelligence as malleable and think about her score as something that can be improved with effort. Endorsing a stability theory would be more threatening to Erika, suggesting her shortcomings are permanent. However, if Tim receives a very high score on the same assessment, he would not be threatened by the notion that intelligence is fixed, because it could allow him to bask in the assurance of his enduring acumen. Our predictions are somewhat asymmetrical in that after success, Tim may enjoy a theory of stability, but would not be especially threatened by a theory of malleability: he could simply imagine further improvement to his considerable skills. Likewise, people are sometimes motivated to view other people in a flattering—or disparaging—light. If Kyle is rooting for a particular 
        <em>American Idol</em> contestant, he may dismiss their dismal performance in a given week as a learning experience, whereas if Kelly is less invested in that contestant’s success, she might see that week’s poor performance as a good indication of the singer’s permanently limited talent. Similarly, a parent in favor of harsh criminal sentencing (“once a thief, always a thief”) might find greater value in malleability beliefs in the event that one of his or her children were to get arrested (“they just need another chance”).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Stated more generally, we suggest that when faced with unflattering evidence of one’s own (or a liked other’s) performance, people may gravitate toward the reassuring notion that people can change. It is plausible that people will shift their preference toward an entity theory after success to highlight its permanence—but this tendency might be weaker because neither implicit theory is especially threatening after success. Conversely, when people consider the glories and shortcomings of disliked others, they may be inclined to shift their views to more often emphasize the stability of flaws and the transience of greatness.</p><a id="psp-107-4-597-EIDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_21" title="Overview of the Present Research">Overview of the Present Research</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">To test these overarching hypotheses, we conducted seven studies examining how people might shift their implicit theories to meet a variety of goals. In Study 1, we manipulated implicit theories of intelligence directly (describing them as changeable or fixed), similar to past research (e.g., 
        Molden et al., 2006). We expected to replicate past research indicating that people’s implicit theories would shift when given direct evidence of the validity of one theory or another. However, we also manipulated whether participants believed they had performed well or poorly on an intelligence test. We reasoned that in the absence of a threat (when they performed well on the test), people would accept whatever theory they were provided. However, if participants believed they did poorly on the test, accepting the theory that intelligence is fixed would force them to draw unwanted conclusions about their intelligence. Accordingly, we predicted that participants who received failure feedback would be especially resistant to an entity theory message (that their intelligence is fixed). In Study 2, we gave participants success or failure feedback on a bogus test of social intelligence. We expected that if someone was given failure feedback, they would shift toward a more incremental theory to lessen the failure’s impact. To test our hypothesis that implicit theories shift only when motivation is strong enough, we also manipulated task legitimacy. We hypothesized that if participants were able to dismiss their failure because the task was unreliable, they would not be motivated to shift their implicit theory. In Study 3, we assigned people to recall either a positive or a negative memory about the self or an acquaintance. We predicted that after recalling a personal (but not an acquaintance’s) past failure, participants would endorse a more incremental perspective, allowing them to unchain themselves from the negative implications of their undesirable past event. In Studies 4, 5, and 6, we examined whether people would shift their implicit theory endorsement to support desired perceptions of relevant others: political candidates affiliated with one’s own preferred party or from the opposing party. Participants read unflattering information about political candidates’ actual past behaviors (Study 4) and were randomly assigned to read about fabricated favorable or unfavorable political pasts regarding a candidate they favored or opposed (Study 5, Study 6). We predicted that participants would shift their implicit theory about change in ways that would support their own candidate and discredit the unwanted candidate. Finally, in Study 7, we examined implicit theory shifting to meet a different goal: that of protecting one’s family from threat. Participants read about a (hypothetical) previously convicted child sex offender being released unsupervised into a community. We experimentally manipulated threat by depicting the release location as distant from the participant’s community (low threat) or inside the participant’s community (high threat). We also examined threat with a categorical variable—whether participants were parents or not. We expected that parents reading about a child sex offender nearby would be most threatened and most motivated to justify their opposition by shifting toward the view that people simply do not change. These various approaches allow us to provide converging evidence of people’s motivated shifts in their implicit theories of change to maintain desired conclusions about the self and about liked, disliked, and even threatening others.
      </p><a id="psp-107-4-597-EHDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_24" title="Study 1">Study 1</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Study 1 was adapted from past research that has manipulated implicit theories of intelligence. Participants were given a (bogus) intelligence test, led to believe they scored very well or poorly (which should either flatter or threaten self-image goals), and then were provided with information arguing that intelligence was either malleable or fixed. Subsequently, participants were asked to report their implicit theories of intelligence. People typically do at least temporarily shift their implicit theories in response to persuasive messages arguing for stability or change, hence we expect this manipulation to affect their endorsement of stability beliefs. However, we thought that people might be more hesitant to accept the implicit theory provided to them when that theory did not support their self-image goals. Specifically, we predicted that after succeeding on the intelligence task, people would be quite willing to adopt either an incremental or entity theory (depending on the theory highlighted in their assigned condition). However, after receiving failure feedback, we expected participants would be resistant to accepting an entity theory even after reading a persuasive argument in its favor, as it suggests that their unwanted performance is a mark of lasting ability.</p><a id="psp-107-4-597-ECHDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">One hundred twenty-four undergraduate students from a Canadian university participated in the study for course credit.

Upon arriving in the lab, participants were seated in individual booths where they completed a questionnaire containing several measures unrelated to the present study. Embedded within this filler questionnaire were two items that measured implicit theories of intelligence. We chose to embed a small number of premeasure items into a larger filler questionnaire to obscure researchers’ interest in these items in particular, and to reduce the chance that participants would later recall and feel pressure to be consistent with their prior responses. These questions were adapted from 
              Dweck (1999) and asked participants to indicate how much they agreed or disagreed (on a 6-point scale) with the following statements: “Although I can learn new things, I feel that my intelligence remains the same” and “I feel I cannot change my intelligence very much.” Scores for each question were reverse coded such that higher scores indicate more incremental views of intelligence, and the two items were averaged (α = .78).

              McFarlin &amp; Blascovich, 1984). Prior to completing the task, participants were told that the RAT is a nationally recognized technique for assessing intelligence, reasoning, and problem-solving ability. The RAT asks participants to think of a word that relates to each of three given stimulus words (e.g., head, street, dark: light). Participants were randomly assigned to receive one of two versions of this RAT test. Participants assigned to the “success” condition were given a test made up of 10 relatively easy RAT items. In contrast, participants in the “failure” condition received a test made up of 10 hard RAT questions. Upon completion, participants were given an answer key and were told to score themselves on the test. The easy and hard tests resulted in more or fewer correct answers, respectively, allowing the experimenters to use the experience of success or failure as the basis for further feedback. Furthermore, biased percentile ranks were assigned to each score, ensuring that all “success” participants scored themselves in the 60th percentile or above and all “failure” participants scored below the 60th percentile.

This means that you can [not] change your overall level of intelligence through extended growth, maturity and life experience . . . Because your intelligence is unstable [stable] over time, this means that your score on the Remote Associates Test does [not] fluctuate or change depending on what time in your life you take the test. Therefore, the score that you received today will [not] be higher or lower than the score you would receive tomorrow or two weeks/months/years from now if you retook the test. Because your score on the Remote Associates Test is malleable [stable] over time, it is a good and accurate indication of one’s overall intelligence.</blockquote></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><em>Manipulation check</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Next, participants were asked to indicate their score on the RAT and to rate how satisfied they were with the score they received on the RAT on a scale from 1 (
              <em>extremely unsatisfied</em>) to 7 (
              <em>extremely satisfied</em>).

Consistent with our expectations and past research manipulating implicit theories, a 2 (test feedback: success vs. failure) × 2 (intelligence implicit theory: stable vs. malleable) analysis of covariance (ANCOVA; controlling for initial implicit theory) revealed a main effect of implicit theory condition: Participants in the malleable condition (
            <em>M</em> = 3.03, 
            <em>SD</em> = .97) endorsed a significantly more malleable view of intelligence than did those in the stable condition (

          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">However, implicit theories were also affected by the test feedback condition. A significant main effect of task outcome indicated that participants in the failure condition expressed a significantly more incremental theory of intelligence (
            <em>M</em> = 2.92, 
            <em>SD</em> = 1.06) than participants in the success condition (
            <em>M</em> = 2.59,

            <em>p</em> = .020, η
            <sup>2</sup> = .05. This is in line with our speculation that people might prefer focusing on mutability after failure, but be happy enough to contemplate their enduring qualities after success.
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">These main effects, however, were qualified by a significant Test Feedback × Implicit Theory interaction, 
            <em>F</em>(1, 118) = 7.71, 
            <em>p</em> = .006, η
            <sup>2</sup> = .061 (see 
            Figure 1). As expected, participants in the success condition reported beliefs about mutability that were consistent with their implicit theory condition, 
            <em>F</em>(1, 118) = 15.67, 
            <em>p</em> &lt; .001. After participants received failure feedback, however, the implicit theories manipulation was not effective, 
            <em>F</em>(1, 118) &lt; 1, 
            <em>ns.</em> More specifically, participants who read that intelligence is malleable were equally likely to endorse an incremental theory whether they were in the success and failure feedback condition, 
            <em>F</em>(1, 118) &lt; 1, 
            <em>n</em>s. In contrast, participants who got failure feedback were significantly less likely to accept an entity theory even when told intelligence is stable, 
            <em>F</em>(1, 118) = 10.11, 
            <em>p</em> = .002. In sum, these results demonstrate that when participants received failure feedback, they tended to adopt more of an incremental perspective, regardless of the implicit theory manipulation. When participants received success feedback, they had no need to defend against unwanted conclusions about their intelligence, and adopted the perspective that was provided.

Within the success condition, we replicated the established finding that implicit theories can be temporarily induced by direct argument in favor of one or the other perspective. That is, after success feedback, participants were willing to adopt either theory, arguably because their self-concept as an intelligent individual was not threatened; it was acceptable to think of their excellence as either enduring (entity) or as further improvable (incremental). In contrast, participants appeared to resist shifting to an entity perspective after failure, even when explicitly presented with information suggesting stability of the dimension. Believing one’s intelligence can change (vs. believing intelligence is fixed) leads to more desirable conclusions about the self after having been provided with dismal evidence of one’s current intelligence. Importantly, however, these data also suggest an important boundary condition: When implicit theory induction conflicts with self-protection motivation, self-image concerns may trump the intended changes in perspective.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">However, in this study all participants were explicitly exposed to argument in favor of one implicit theory or the other; hence, we find evidence of accepting or resisting these theories but do not directly test whether people more spontaneously shift their theories in the absence of any implicit theory information. In Study 2, we move to clarify the results of Study 1 by exposing participants to success or failure feedback without a direct implicit theory induction. Further, to test the hypothesis that these effects would occur only when people are highly motivated to reach a directional conclusion, we manipulated the legitimacy of the test. We expected that participants would only shift their implicit theories in response to feedback that is perceived as a legitimate reflection of ability. If the test was not framed as valid and legitimate, then motivation to shift their beliefs would not be present.</p><a id="psp-107-4-597-EGDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_51" title="Study 2">Study 2</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In Study 2, we gave participants a novel task that purportedly measured “thin-slice social perceptiveness,” a key component of social intelligence that predicts a wide range of positive life outcomes (e.g., salary, promotions, romantic success). Posttask we delivered false feedback (success or failure). We expected that if someone was given failure feedback, they would shift toward a more incremental theory to lessen the failure’s impact.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Given our overarching motivated reasoning hypotheses, we also wanted to directly manipulate the extent to which participants were motivated to shift their implicit theories. Thus, we manipulated task legitimacy to alter the degree to which people would care about the task and consider it meaningful if they failed. In one condition, the task was described as new and unreliable, and in the other the task was described as rigorously tested and a very valid predictor. We hypothesized that if participants were able to dismiss their “failure” because the task was unreliable, they would not be motivated to shift their implicit theory.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Additionally, in Study 2 we sought to examine some downstream effects of implicit theory shifting. We measured participant expectation of future performance and willingness to re-take the test in future. We predicted that after experiencing a failure (in the legitimate condition), participants who shifted toward a more incremental theory would have a more optimistic outlook on their future potential, and would thus be more likely to express interest in re-taking the test. As well, in Study 2 we measured implicit theories within the general person domain and the intelligence domain, and also adapted the scale to measure social intelligence implicit theories. We expected that because the test was said to reflect social intelligence, domain-specific social intelligence implicit theories would be most prone to shift. We thought it was also plausible that people would shift their general person theories to some degree, and least likely that they would shift in the unrelated domain of intelligence, because a shift in this domain would not allow them to reach desired conclusions about social intelligence. Finally, we counterbalanced when participants had the opportunity to complete the implicit theories scale—half received the scale immediately after test feedback, and half received the items about future performance and re-take willingness first, with the implicit theories scale afterward. If the shift occurs solely when “on paper” (when participants are explicitly presented with an implicit theories measure), we might expect to find an effect only in the “implicit theories first” condition. However, if people to some degree spontaneously shift implicit theories even when unprompted by a questionnaire, then the counterbalance condition may not matter.</p><a id="psp-107-4-597-ECGDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Two hundred forty-six American residents recruited from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk participated in our online study in exchange for $0.50 dollars.

Among other filler items (to mask the focus on the premeasure), participants first responded to three general person and one intelligence implicit theory item. Following this, all participants read instructions describing “thin-slice social perceptiveness” as a key component of social intelligence that enables people to “intuit and predict a lot about people they have just met or seen” on the basis of very little exposure. We told participants that people vary in this ability and that it predicts a wide range of measures of life success (e.g., relationship success, income, promotions, persuasiveness). They were told they would view photos of students who had all indicated their future career goals. They would view each photo along with two goal statements—one that belonged to that student and one that did not. Their task was to match the correct career goal with the student in the photo. They were randomly assigned to read either that the test was legitimate (i.e., 
            <em>a reliable indicator of thin-slice social perceptiveness that predicts the previously mentioned outcomes</em>) or that it was not legitimate (i.e., 
            <em>it was not a final version of the test, and its reliability and ability to predict outcomes was unknown</em>).

            <em>very poorly</em>, 7 = 
            <em>very well</em>), then completed an implicit theories measure containing social intelligence, general person, and intelligence theories. Participants then indicated how well they expected to perform if they took the test again (their expected score, 0–12 correct) and then asked how interested they would be in taking the task a second time at a later date via a binary yes/no item and an interest item (“How interested are you in taking the test again?”; 1 = 
            <em>extremely uninterested</em>, 7 = 
            <em>extremely interested</em>). The implicit theory scale and the re-take willingness items were counterbalanced. Finally, participants indicated the score they remembered receiving on the test (0/12 – 12/12; an attention check) and reported demographic information (gender, age). Just before debriefing, we again asked participants about their level of focus on the study.

This provides context to the results of Study 1, which primarily showed resistance to an entity theory after failure, and more directly tests our hypothesis that these effects will only occur when sufficiently motivated. Further, we show in the failure condition only, shifting toward an incremental theory of social intelligence (the ostensible focus of the test) predict more optimistic future performance expectations and more interest in retaking the test. This result supports our interpretation of Study 1’s effects: Failure provokes movement toward an incremental theory, thus it is likely that participants in Study 1 were indeed resisting the undesirable entity manipulation after failure because an incremental theory would be more desirable.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Our overarching hypothesis is that people can strategically shift their implicit theory to help them support a desired conclusion or opinion. We do not claim that implicit theories are people’s only “out” in threatening contexts (e.g., failure feedback) but that they can—and will—shift their implicit theories if the ability to change is salient. If participants had another “out” (like disregarding the legitimacy of the test), then they did not shift. However, it is notable that counterbalancing did not play a role—people appeared to be shifting somewhat spontaneously whether immediately presented with the measure or not. They showed the same patterns whether they shifted their theories first, or right after reporting willingness to retake.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In the following studies, we move away from present-moment success or failure to study contexts where change is naturally salient: considering a past self (have I changed since then?), considering the past actions of politicians (do their past actions matter?), and considering the past actions of a convicted felon (are they still dangerous?).</p><a id="psp-107-4-597-EFDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_89" title="Study 3">Study 3</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Studies 1 and 2 suggest that people gravitate toward a particular implicit theory—and even resist information to the contrary—when it serves to protect a favorable self-view. Study 3 conceptually replicates Study 2 in a novel domain (social skills), using a valenced memory recall manipulation rather than false feedback. Autobiographical memory is another natural context where beliefs about change or stability should be very important: Past selves can reflect directly on a present self or be seen as distinct from the “new me” (
        Libby &amp; Eibach, 2002; 
        McFarland &amp; Buehler, 2012). As in Study 2, we expected that a recent failure would be less threatening if people moved toward the implicit theory that suggests they can change (because they could improve their ability in the future). In the present study, we argue that recalling a past social failure will be less threatening if people invoke the belief that social ability is changeable. Past events have less power to taint present self-views when people believe they have changed over time (
        Libby &amp; Eibach, 2002); shifting toward an incremental implicit theory would support this perception. Conversely, if people believe their attributes are fixed over time, salient past events would have direct implications for current self-views (If I was a social success in the past, and I cannot change, I still am today).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Because we suggest that this is a motivated process intended to help people reach desired conclusions, we expected that if people do not have a vested interest in the conclusions they draw, they should have no inclination to selectively gravitate toward a particular implicit theory. Accordingly, we expected to observe implicit theory shifting when people contemplated negative events from their own past but not when they thought of the experiences of an acquaintance. Moreover, we again measured multiple implicit theory domains: personality, social skills, and morality. As in Study 2, we expected shifting within relevant domains (social skills and the broad domain of personality), but not within clearly unrelated domains (e.g., morality).</p><a id="psp-107-4-597-ECFDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">One hundred eight undergraduate students from a Canadian university participated in the study for course credit (70 women;

Participants were prompted to recall and write about either a social success or failure from within the past 4 years for either themselves or an acquaintance. In the success condition, participants were asked to think about a time in which they (or an acquaintance) felt socially accepted, socially skilled, and/or popular. In the failure condition, participants were asked to think about a time in which they (or an acquaintance) felt socially rejected, alone, or socially awkward. Participants wrote a short paragraph about the recalled event and estimated the date (month and year) that it occurred. They were also asked to report “How did this event make you feel at the time?” (0 = 
            <em>very badly</em>; 10 =

              <em>“</em>There is not much that can be done to change a person’s social skills and popularity,” α = .60) created by the authors. Because people were asked to recall a 
              <em>social</em> memory, we wanted to test whether people would shift their implicit theories specifically regarding sociability and social skill. We also thought it was likely that people’s general person theories would shift. Because morality theories are further removed from the types of memories recalled, we expected these implicit theories would not be likely to shift.

Finally, note that implicit theories in the moral domain did not differ by condition, consistent with the findings of Study 2: It seems that people will only shift their theories in domains that are relevant to the conclusions they hope to draw. In the present study, participants reacted within general domains (the “kind of person” one is) and specific ones (the social domain) but excluded a specific domain that did not pertain to the situation (morality).</p><a id="psp-107-4-597-EEDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_111" title="Study 4">Study 4</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">So far, we have demonstrated that people may shift their endorsement of implicit theories in ways that help them to reach desired conclusions about the self (or avoid undesirable conclusions). By selecting an incremental lens through which they can interpret evidence of failure as changeable, people can protect their self-concepts from concerns that their shortcomings will endure. However, people are not only motivated to regulate their views about the self—they are often inclined to reach particular conclusions about others (e.g., 
        Morgan, Mullen, &amp; Skitka, 2010). In Studies 4, 5, and 6, we extend our investigation to include important others. We work through (and test) the assumption that individuals who affiliate with a particular political party are motivated to view their own party’s candidate favorably, and are motivated to view opposing parties’ candidates unfavorably. When evaluating current political candidates, voters often have to sift through a great deal of information about their recent and distant past performance, and have to decide which evidence is pertinent to their current judgments of candidates. For example, “attack ads” dredge up misdeeds from a candidate’s often distant past with the hope that these will be considered a lasting mark on that candidate’s character. However, long-past foibles can just as easily be dismissed as irrelevant. Should a candidate’s past political missteps, past drug use, or marital infidelity, and other earlier regrettable actions be considered when judging current and future performance? There is no clear-cut answer to this question: Evidence is often ambiguous and will be colored by the lens through which it is interpreted. In Studies 4–6, we examine how people might adopt particular implicit theories to help them interpret political pasts in a manner consistent with the conclusions they wish to draw about a candidate.

Participants were randomly assigned to read unflattering quotations from either the Liberal or Conservative party leaders. We used real statements uttered by candidates an average of 10 years ago, many of which were actively being used as ammunition in the media. We predicted that when people read damaging quotes attributed to their favored candidate, they would shift their dominant implicit theory of the candidate in the incremental direction. In contrast, we expected people would be more likely to invoke an entity implicit theory (at their core, this person does not change) when reading the regrettable statements made by the opposing party’s candidate. We have suggested that shifting implicit theories helps people to reach desired conclusions. To examine the downstream effects of implicit theories, we also asked participants how relevant past statements were to candidates’ current standing.

We argue that people might gravitate toward the implicit theory that allows them to either dismiss past misdemeanors as irrelevant to current political concerns or hold onto past misdeeds as lasting marks of character (depending on whether they want to support or discredit the candidate). To examine this mediation hypothesis, we first examine voters’ assessment of the quotations’ relevance to the current election, then assess whether differences in relevance are accounted for by implicit theory endorsement. The expected Voter × Candidate interaction emerged,

            <em>can</em> change. We predict that this differential implicit theory endorsement might underlie the tendency to discount unflattering information about favored candidate (because they are so changeable) but to view their (unchanging) opponent’s past statements as still pertinent to their current standing in the polls. A mediation analysis was conducted (
            <em>n</em> = 123) via bootstrapping using the method outlined by 
            Preacher and Hayes (2008). The Condition × Voter interaction term was entered as the independent variable (controlling main effects and initial politician implicit theory), candidate implicit theory was entered as the mediator, and participant ratings of how much the negative quotes should affect a candidate’s current standing in the election were entered as the dependent variable (see 
            Figure 5). Bootstrapping (1,000 samples, 95% CIs) revealed a significant indirect effect, CI [.90, 2.74], 
            <em>p</em> &lt; .05, suggesting that some of the effect of the interaction occurs through implicit theories of a candidate’s malleability. The alternate model in which judgments about the negative quotations’ relevance acted as the mediator, and implicit theory acted as the outcome, was also significant, CI [−1.98, −.79], 
            <em>p</em> &lt; .05. Althoughplausible—voters’ wish to have the quotes be relevant could have influenced their judgments of changeability—we chose voter implicit theory as the mediator because (a) implicit theories were reported immediately after voters read the quotations and (b) the direct effect was still significant after the inclusion of implicit theories—political bias was still enacting a powerful effect on relevance.

Study 4 extends this to assessments of important others: political candidates who one cares about supporting or opposing. Voters confront a great deal of information about political candidates coming up to an election and must decide what facts to weigh as pertinent or irrelevant to their assessment of candidates’ current character. The results of Study 4 demonstrate that people do this in a far from even-handed manner and may recruit implicit theories that help support their contention that decade-old unflattering utterances either are central to a candidate’s current standing or are simply irrelevant to the decision at hand.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Of course, one limitation to Study 4 is that participants were exposed to solely negative information about candidates, which does not allow us to determine the causal effect of the valence of past information. Although the mediational analyses lend support to our contention that participants shifted their implicit theories to either deflect or compound the impact of damaging past statements (because implicit theories mediated current judgments of statement relevance), it is possible that voters held an implicit theory specific to each candidate coming into the study (even though they did not differ on their implicit theories of politicians in general); each candidate may have been a “domain of their own” for each participant.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In Study 5, we sought to replicate and extend Study 4 by including an experimental manipulation of the valence of a political past. In this way, we can determine whether voters of same political leaning actually endorse different implicit theories when evaluating the same candidate, depending on the way the candidate’s past is described, thereby addressing the ambiguity of Study 4. Further, rather than relying on actual past events, we created fabricated favorable or unfavorable records of actions for the same time period (Barack Obama’s time in the Senate). We sacrifice some ecological validity in favor of increased experimental control (reversing the balance in Study 4).</p><a id="psp-107-4-597-EDDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_145" title="Study 5">Study 5</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We presented participants with a positive or a negative representation of Barack Obama’s time as senator (during 2005–2008). As in Study 4, we hypothesized that in the negative past condition, Republican participants would endorse an entity view of President Obama (i.e., that he cannot really change), whereas Democrats would endorse a more incremental view of President Obama (i.e., that he is malleable). Consistent with Studies 1–3, we did not expect any significant differences between Republicans and Democrats in the positive condition, because neither malleability nor stability poses an inherent challenge to a favorable past record: An entity theory suggests the candidate will continue to be successful, and an incremental theory allows the candidate to improve (or decline).</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Additionally, it is important to note the difference in context between Study 4 and Study 5. In Study 4, the election was in full swing, and all politicians were candidates—no one was incumbent and “safe” from losing their position. In contrast, Study 5 was conducted outside of the election cycle. There was an incumbent (Obama) who is not threatened within an election campaign. Thus, we expected that any observed effects would be stronger among Republicans, as the Democratic President Obama (the focus on the study) was safer from any damaging effects than the candidates in Study 4.</p><a id="psp-107-4-597-ECDDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Two hundred fifty American residents recruited from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk participated in our online study in exchange for $0.40 dollars (148 females, two undisclosed).</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Participant inclusion/exclusion</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We excluded six participants who failed an attention check.

After this, we also had participants complete the original general personal implicit theory scale. Finally, participants responded to the question, “Some would say that a politician’s past deeds are an indication of current views and others would say they are irrelevant. How much do you think Obama’s track record as Senator reflects his

A mediation analysis (see 
              Figure 8) was conducted (
              <em>n</em> = 179) via bootstrapping using the method outlined by 
              Preacher and Hayes (2008). The Condition × Voter interaction term was entered as the independent variable (controlling for main effects and the implicit theory premeasures), reported implicit theory about President Obama was entered as the mediator, and participant ratings of relevance of Senate record to current standing was entered as the dependent variable. Bootstrapping (1,000 samples, 95% CIs) revealed a significant indirect effect, CI [−.27, −.02], 
              <em>p</em> &lt; .05, suggesting that some of the effect of the interaction on the perceived relevance of Obama’s Senatorial performance occurs through judgments of Obama’s changeability. As in Study 4, the alternate model wherein the “current views” item acts as mediator, and the implicit theory acts as the outcome, was also significant, CI [−.63, −.10]. The logic behind our preferred model is the same: we argue that voters start with a generalized motivation to “harm the opposing candidate” or “support my candidate”—and then shift their implicit theory to accommodate that desire; the “current views” item is the eventual supported conclusion. As before, the alternate model is of course plausible, where the “current views” item is the desired conclusion, and one’s implicit theory is shifted to support it. In either case, we argue the process is that of motivated reasoning.

The data demonstrate a reliable relative difference between the implicit theories of Obama endorsed by his supporters versus opponents—but only after reading about his past failings. Indeed, it appeared to be opponents who drove this effect by gravitating toward an entity theory to enhance the relevance of his negative past. Obama supporters were quite incremental across both conditions; it may be that they saw Obama as changeable from the outset so had no additional need to shift their implicit theories further. Though we have more clearly demonstrated shifting in Study 5, we again primarily measured implicit theory specific to the politician in question. Though we did include general person implicit theory as a secondary measure, it was unaffected by condition. This could be because participants would only ever shift their theories of the candidate themselves. Instead, we suspect that general person theory was unaffected because participants were already able to garner the support they needed to reach their desired conclusion on the initial candidate-specific scale (
          Tesser, 2001). Given this ambiguity, in Study 6 we only use the general person implicit theory scale to better test whether people might shift their more general implicit theories if this is the opportunity they are given to support their desired conclusion. Further, we move to support our motivated account by including a neutral condition in which participants consider a candidate they are not biased for or against. We expected that those reading about a neutral candidate (from another country) would not shift their implicit theories in response to valenced information.

This more directly tests whether people might adjust their general implicit theories to support a desired conclusion about a candidate. Second, we wanted to further test our contention that people shift their implicit theories when sufficiently motivated.

Although the legal system mandates specific types and lengths of punishment for different crimes, beliefs about whether former criminal offenders should be evaluated with a “clean slate” or not after completing their sentence is a matter of debate. Employers routinely consider past criminal records (and not without reason), at least implicitly endorsing the view that a person’s past actions are a reflection of his or her character and hence a sign of possible future behavior. Employers often have to make judgments and predictions about former convicts with limited personal knowledge, and may rely on their implicit theories about change and stability to help them interpret the incomplete information they have. Some crimes may be far more likely viewed as a mark of enduring character (or disorder) than others: sexual assault may carry many more entity implications than reckless driving, for instance. Child sexual assault is arguably near the top of the list of enduring crimes, where many people have such strong beliefs about the likelihood of recidivism that a previous offender is destined to face suspicion and harassment regardless of how much time has passed since the offence. The National Sex Offender registry (
        
<a href="http://www.nsopw.gov" target="_blank">http://www.nsopw.gov</a> in the U.S.), which allows the public access to information about previously convicted sex offenders, is a uniquely concrete instantiation of entity assumptions about sex offenders. The present study does not attempt to evaluate the appropriateness or accuracy of these implicit beliefs (and we acknowledge that recidivism rates 
        <em>do</em> differ for different crimes; 
        Statistics Canada, 2002). Instead, we investigate the psychological element of these perceptions: whether people might be especially likely to recruit a strong entity implicit theory to protect their family when situational threat is highest.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In the present study, we asked people to react to a hypothetical scenario involving a formerly convicted—and apparently rehabilitated—child sex offender. Most people might find a child sex offender worthy of caution or suspicion, evidence of rehabilitation notwithstanding. That said, we expected that some groups of people would be more threatened than others. We examined threat via one categorical variable and one manipulated variable. First, we expected that parents would be more threatened by a child sex offender than nonparents. Second, we expected that people would be more threatened if they were told that the previously convicted sex offender was requesting permission to relocate to their community (vs. a community 200 miles away). We predict that parents who encounter a proximal threat to their children will be motivated to exaggerate the threat to enhance vigilance to the danger, akin to how people especially fearful of spiders visually exaggerate their perceived size (
        Vasey et al., 2012). Hence, 
        <em>parents</em> who expected the previously convicted child sex offender to move 
        <em>into their neighborhood</em> should be most concerned and most likely to invoke a more entity implicit theory (i.e., if people fundamentally do not change, then they are justified in their resistance to giving this former convict a second chance). Nonparents and those who expected the sex offender to relocate to a distant community—that is, those who are relatively unthreatened by this former criminal—should have little reason to shift their implicit theories.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In the previous studies, to avoid consistency demands, we did not include a complete measure of implicit theories prior to the manipulation, though in some cases, we embedded a single item into the premeasure. In the present study, however, we wanted to directly examine the degree to which people shift their endorsed implicit theory even over a relatively short time span when faced with a compelling enough reason to change their viewpoint. We included the general person implicit theories scale (
        Dweck, 1999) at the beginning of the study and then asked participants to complete the identical scale after reading the scenario. This allows us to more directly examine the degree to which people shift from their initial theory after the experimental manipulation. Note that we did not expect that people would make wholesale jumps to the other side of the implicit theory continuum (e.g., a strong incrementalist would not transform into a committed entity theorist). Other research has demonstrated that attitudes and beliefs will change, but within constraints set by their starting point (
        Sanitioso, Kunda, &amp; Fong, 1990; 
        Starzyk, Fabrigar, Soryal, &amp; Fanning, 2009).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We also asked participants to evaluate the offender at the time of the conviction and postrehabilitation. We expected that participants—particularly those who were most threatened by the offender (parents who envisioned him relocating nearby) might adopt a more stable implicit theory as a means of justifying their continued condemnation of the offender. We expected that all participants would deplore the offender’s actions at the time of conviction but that they might differ in the degree to which they gave him the benefit of the doubt closer to the present. Despite being provided evidence of the offender’s exemplary behavior during rehabilitation, we thought that participants who shifted toward an entity implicit theory would be most unwilling to set aside past actions, and would continue to condemn the offender even after rehabilitation.</p><a id="psp-107-4-597-ECBDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">One hundred eighty American residents recruited from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk participated in our online study in exchange for $0.50 dollars.

However, the scenario was constructed in such a way that participants could give the offender “credit” for his exemplary behaviors during the rehabilitative process, including his excellent behaviors noted during the previous year while on parole. We expected that those participants most threatened by the offender (parents in the close relocation condition) would be most likely to cling to his past behavior as the true mark of his character and resist giving him the benefit of the doubt regarding his recent behavior. Participants were asked to rate the valence of the offender’s past behaviors (i.e., at conviction) and recent behaviors (i.e., at rehabilitation)—differences between these ratings can indicate perceived change over time. We ran a mixed ANCOVA controlling for age and gender, with time (at conviction vs. rehabilitation) as the within-subject variable and proximity (close vs. distant) and parenthood (parent vs. nonparent) as between-subjects variables. Not surprisingly, a main effect of time,

            <em>p</em>s &gt; .18). However, participants’ ratings of the offender’s recent behaviors revealed a significant Proximity × Parenthood interaction,

            <em>p</em> = .003, η
            <sup>2</sup> = .06. Simple effects indicated that parents reading about the offender relocating to their community rated his recent behaviors during rehabilitation less favorably (

This suggests that participants most likely to be threatened (parents considering a proximal offender) were less likely to acknowledge that exemplary recent behaviors might reflect real change.

The Proximity × Parenthood interaction was entered as the independent variable, offender behavior ratings at rehabilitation as the dependent variable, and the postimplicit theories as the mediator. We expected that people’s shifts in implicit theories would at least partially mediate people’s judgments of offender rehabilitation (those who gravitate toward an incremental theory would see the most evidence of positive rehabilitation).

Only participants with a specific reason to see a former child sex offender as a direct threat (parents imagining the offender moving nearby) shifted their implicit theories to invoke the belief that people’s core attributes really do not change. Furthermore, this shift toward the entity perspective predicted more unforgiving evaluations of the offender postrehabilitation. Selective implicit theory endorsement in this domain seemed particularly relevant given the debate about sex offender registries and the degree to which they should be available to the public (e.g., 
          LaGinga, 2007; 
          Lancaster, 2013).
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">These findings also suggest how emotions can play a role in the development of public policy, leading to a form of NIMBYism (“Not In My Back Yard”; see 
          Schively, 2007, for a review). As this study shows, it is acceptable for a felon who has completed his or her sentence to be reintegrated into a community as part of his or her rehabilitation; however, this reintegration is only acceptable if it is done in a community far away. If the reintegration takes place in one’s own community, then the idea that the felon 
          <em>could have been</em> rehabilitated is eschewed (at least by the parents in that community) in favor of the idea that “once a felon, always a felon.”
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">These findings suggest that, to promote the safety of their families, people may shift their basic assumptions about crime and their corresponding implicit theories about the stability of core traits. Rather than relying on empirical evidence of rehabilitation or actual recidivism risks, people may reframe the debate by shifting their underlying beliefs about whether rehabilitation is even possible. In some cases, this protective instinct might serve us well to guard against threat; in other cases, it likely produces unintended consequences including a self-fulfilling prophecy (e.g., marginalized felons who are barred from reintegration may be more likely to reoffend; 
          Nilsson, 2003).

Further, we demonstrate that this process depends on motivation; when we removed the motivation to reach a particular directional conclusion (manipulated in various ways in Studies 2, 3, 6, and 7), participants did not shift.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">When people are faced with information about themselves or relevant others, that information has different implications depending on whether they adopt a belief that people change or stay the same over time. Specifically, negative information is less relevant (and less threatening) now if viewed as potentially changeable rather than fixed: An earlier foible can be relegated to the past or seen as a lasting mark on one’s character depending on the implicit theory accessed in making the judgment. Although past research has certainly demonstrated that implicit theories are sensitive to situational factors such as parent/teacher feedback and direct argument/intervention (
        Aronson et al., 2002; 
        Good et al., 2012; 
        Hong et al., 1999; 
        Mueller &amp; Dweck, 1998; 
        Plaks &amp; Stecher, 2007), our findings are the first to demonstrate a motivated shift in implicit theories in a variety of domains in which people are motivated to reach a specific, directional conclusion about the self or others.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">All seven studies in the present article were designed to present participants with information about the self or relevant others in which an incremental theory would lead to different conclusions about an individual’s present or future attributes than would an entity theory. Studies 1–3 demonstrated that people prefer an incremental theory when faced with negative information about the self (either a current or past failure). Indeed, Study 1 demonstrated that self-protective goals may trump the well-established effect of the implicit theories manipulation: People rejected arguments in favor of entity theory when accepting it would have implied that their current failures in intelligence would endure. Although past research has shown entity beliefs to be maladaptive following failure (
        Dweck &amp; Leggett, 1988), these results provide an intriguing first hint that people may be able to shift away from that perspective when sufficiently motivated to do so, potentially avoiding negative outcomes. Of course, in the real world, people have competing motivations and ways to handle threat: We do not argue that people will always adaptively shift to an incremental view in the face of failure—if they did, far fewer negative effects of entity theory in achievement contexts would be observed in the literature (e.g., 
        Dweck, Chiu, &amp; Hong, 1995b; 
        Henderson &amp; Dweck, 1990; 
        Hong et al., 1999; 
        Nussbaum &amp; Dweck, 2008). However, it may suggest that understanding the motivational influences on implicit theory endorsement could help researchers and educators create even more effective interventions and to understand factors that could put people at risk of adopting maladaptive theories. For instance, people might be especially receptive to arguments in favor of an incremental theory while a recent failure still stings: this may be an ideal time to introduce an intervention. Conversely, people might be at risk of gravitating toward an entity theory after a string of successes, when people would most desire to attribute these outcomes to enduring personal qualities.
        <a id="b-fn6"> </a><sup /></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Studies 4–6 demonstrated that we may also invoke different implicit theories to interpret the histories of relevant others, such as political candidates we support or oppose. We can brush aside the attack ad “dirt” on our favorite candidate by resonating with an incremental theory, and we can allow similar mud to “stick” to a disliked candidate by shifting toward an entity viewpoint. Finally, Study 7 showed that when people had special reason to be threatened by a previously convicted child sex offender (parents in close proximity), the notion that 
        <em>people, at core, never change</em> was highly endorsed. In each case, we show evidence that participants select an implicit theory that best benefits their current motivations. The dynamic shifts in implicit theories in this context may indicate that motivated cognition is likely to push aside empirical evidence to even influence policy decisions. Indeed, 
        Rattan, Savani, Naidu, and Dweck (2012) showed that implicit theories about the changeability of intelligence predict support for educational programs—thus, it is plausible that people’s perceptions of the changeability of those with criminal records are involved in their judgments about legal policy and politics (e.g., punishment vs. rehabilitation).
      </p><a id="psp-107-4-597-ECADA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Theory Fluidity Versus Chronicity?</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Although we highlight a previously undocumented fluidity in individuals’ implicit theories, our findings are not inconsistent with current theory and research. Past research shows that implicit theories can quite readily be shifted by feedback, argument, or intervention favoring one perspective (
          Aronson et al., 2002; 
          Good et al., 2012; 
          Hong et al., 1999; 
          Mueller &amp; Dweck, 1998; 
          Plaks &amp; Stecher, 2007); 
          Dweck and Leggett (1988) recognized the possibility that yet other situational factors might alter people’s implicit beliefs. Our findings are the first to demonstrate how readily and systematically people’s implicit theories might shift when they can be a tool to help people reach preferred conclusions.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Moreover, our findings do not suggest that chronic individual differences in implicit theories do not matter. Participants only shifted when they were sufficiently motivated by a threat to self-concept, to defend or cast aspersions on liked or disliked others, or to erect a protective barrier around one’s children. In addition, even under these circumstances, people did not entirely switch allegiance—people’s implicit theories fall on a continuum even though they are often described as “either” incremental or entity, and we describe systematic, nontrivial shifts toward one end or the other of the scale, not total conversion across groups. Nonetheless, these shifts in theory were consequential: they predicted people’s reactions to failing a test, willingness to overlook the past transgressions of political candidates, and even judgments of a previously convicted criminal’s rehabilitation. Even if these shifts in implicit theories are relatively temporary and fluctuating, they could play an important role in personal performance decisions, in the voting booth, and in the jury box.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">It is likely that even with these implicit theory shifts, chronic theories matter. People may even return to some chronic “baseline” when the threat passes. Although our studies are not designed to examine these possibilities, future research should examine the interplay between the chronicity and fluidity of implicit theories. It may be that some people are more apt to shift than others, or perhaps everyone’s theory endorsement is subject to revision but within constraints set by their dominant theories (e.g., 
          Sanitioso et al., 1990). Our findings might indirectly shed light as well on how chronic implicit theories develop. If people regularly find themselves in situations where an entity or an incremental theory allows them to reach their preferred conclusions, they may gravitate toward that preferred theory more and more often until it becomes their chronic or dominant perspective. This might suggest, for instance, that a year of mixed successes in class or in sports would encourage a more incremental perspective than a year of straight As or wins on the field (see 
          Mueller &amp; Dweck, 1998, for related phenomena). People who constantly succeed may begin to adopt an entity theory of talent over hard work, much like children praised for performance do (
          Mueller &amp; Dweck, 1998). Indeed, one instance of maladaptive praise (“you’re so smart!”) does not set a child’s implicit theory for life—it is consistent reinforcement of a certain theory over the course of years that is hypothesized to move someone to adopt their chronic implicit theory. In the present research, we posit that this reinforcement need not be so explicit or external. Internally driven motivations (perhaps paired with more external feedback) may, over time, shape the chronic implicit theories people come to hold.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">It should be noted that previous research has demonstrated that in certain circumstances, participants react negatively when presented with evidence opposing their chronic theory. Specifically, 
          Plaks, Grant, and Dweck (2005) and 
          Plaks and Stecher (2007) found that participants provided with information that violated their dominant theory experienced anxiety and exhibited attempts to reestablish personal control (i.e., persisted longer at a task giving theory-violating feedback). Plaks and colleagues argued that the pattern of results indicated that participants will resist moving from their dominant theory. How, then, do we reason participants will shift on their own? First, in the research conducted by Plaks and colleagues, stimuli were set up to directly contradict people’s expectations about others (
          Plaks et al., 2005) and their own performance (
          Plaks &amp; Stecher, 2007). Hence, in those studies, the implicit theory itself was salient and, presumably, under threat. We hypothesize that participants may not always be so committed to a salient dominant implicit theory, particularly if some other aspect of the self (or relevant other) is under threat instead. That is, participants will shift their implicit theory to preserve a different and more salient goal. Whereas Plaks and colleagues showed that people are motivated to preserve their dominant theory when it is directly threatened, we demonstrate that people are motivated to shift their implicit theories when other, personally important views are threatened.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Indeed, 
          Plaks and Stecher (2007) argued that people should be made aware of the potential maladaptiveness of each theory, and interventions to educate lay people about the consequences of holding a given theory of change would help them more flexibly adapt to situations. They suggest that such interventions could have implications for academic and interpersonal success. The data presented here, coupled with work by 
          Poon and Koehler (2008), suggests that people already do this flexible adaptation to some degree. However, in many situations, it is obvious that the “wrong” theory is maintained (e.g., 
          Dweck et al., 1995a; 
          Dweck &amp; Leggett, 1988) and people fall into self-defeating motivational patterns (
          Nussbaum &amp; Dweck, 2008).

We focused on goals related to protecting the self and relevant others from threat, and the related goal of disparaging others that could be a source of threat (see also 
            Rattan et al., 2012). It is plausible that implicit theories may be flexibly summoned in support of many other goals as well: From coping with a trauma to eliciting optimal task motivation, people may benefit from having access to, and the ability to flexibly move back and forth between, both theories. Similarly, people may shift toward a particular theory to support their political views on specific issues—causes of and possible responses to everything from poverty to drug use to homosexuality may be heavily influenced by whether an incremental or entity view is invoked. In close relationships, people may benefit from shifting toward an entity theory when sailing is smooth but quickly lean on an incremental view in stormier weather.
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Mechanism</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Although this article has provided evidence for the existence of implicit theory shifting, the precise mechanism by which people shift their implicit theories remains undocumented. Indeed, we focus primarily on shifting implicit theories 
            <em>as the mechanism by which</em> people successfully support the conclusions they wish to reach. However, past research suggests likely processes that may account for some of this shifting. 
            Sanitioso and colleagues (1990) demonstrated that shifts in self-views are accomplished via a motivated memory search for supporting evidence (and hence limited by the number of supporting instances recalled). 
            Poon and Koehler (2006) showed that people have access to supporting examples of both implicit theories: whichever comes to mind might determine the situational shift. Indeed, chronic or dominant theories might be characterized by the set of memories experienced with greatest fluency, with its corresponding effect on judgments of veracity (
            Unkelbach, 2007; 
            Wänke, Bohner, &amp; Jurkowitsch, 1997).
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Who is shifting?</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Might the tendency to flexibly shift theories (or not) be an individual difference in itself? Work by 
            Ziegler and Stoeger (2010) potentially speaks to this issue. Their research revealed that highly successful students treated successes and failures with different theories of change: successes were seen as fairly permanent, whereas failures and ability deficits were seen as changeable. Although the authors suggested that gifted students have separate “domains” for success and failure—even within the highly specific domain of “physics class,” for example—we would suggest that highly successful students are simply more adept at shifting their implicit theories to motivate themselves. That is, when they succeed, they will believe (temporarily) in permanence, but when they fail, they cleave to mutability. It may be that the more easily a student is able to shift from one theory to the other depending on context, the more they conserve and promote their scholastic motivation, and in turn the more successful they are in academics.
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In addition to individual differences in flexibility, it is possible that different people shift their implicit theories in different contexts. For example, someone who is already an incremental theorist may not need to shift as much as an entity theorist after failure because their dominant theory already protects them from threat. In contrast, it might be the incremental theorist who does more shifting in contexts where an entity perspective will help them support their preferred conclusions (such as holding on to the past misdeeds of a disliked political candidate). Future research into this issue could preselect a large number of incremental and entity theorists at the outset to systematically examine where the shifting takes place.</p><a id="psp-107-4-597-EAADA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Conclusion</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The present research complements and extends past implicit theory research by Dweck and colleagues’ by demonstrating how people selectively shift their implicit theory endorsement to help them reach the conclusions they most desire about themselves and others. These findings are highly consistent with the body of work demonstrating that implicit theories are sensitive to situational feedback, context, and argument (
          Blackwell et al., 2007; 
          Hong et al., 1999; 
          Molden et al., 2006; 
          Murphy &amp; Dweck, 2010; 
          Plaks &amp; Stecher, 2007. Unlike past research, however, we demonstrate that people alter their theories without any direct message priming or encouragement to take one perspective or the other: they appear to have access to both and can toggle toward one or the other as the situation demands. This has both positive implications (for self-protection after failure, for instance) and more gloomy ones (people may “attack” others and make their past misdeeds “stick” by selecting an entity theory for the occasion). Voting and policy decisions may be made by appealing to basic assumptions about the fixed or mutable nature of attributes—but even those basic assumptions may not be as reliable or consistently applied as previously thought. This work reveals the dynamic nature of implicit theories of change and suggests that they are more flexible than previously conceived. This initial step into examining the change in people’s theories of change enables reinterpretations of past research, and present several new avenues of future research. Future research should more fully explore the links between theory chronicity and flexibility, and how our knowledge of one informs and modifies our understanding of the other.

In the initial study, we did not include a premeasure of social intelligence implicit theory (because we were not sure participants would know what the term meant). In the replication, we added a premeasure item defining and measuring lay theories of social intelligence (and included it as a covariate). Participants who received failure feedback reported significantly more incremental social intelligence implicit theory (

We wondered whether people who experienced more academic disappointments over the course of a term might show a tendency to prefer an incremental theory over time, whereas those who experienced mostly successes might be tempted to begin adopting a more entity perspective. At the beginning of the fall term, we obtained implicit theories (intelligence and general person) scores, then followed up in the winter term (4–6 months later) with 
          <em>N</em> = 41 students. We asked these students to report extensively on their academic outcomes in the previous term. They listed each major test and assignment in each class they took the previous semester and indicated whether the outcome on that unit was something they viewed as a disappointment, as a success, or as neutral (neither a success nor a disappointment). We also obtained their intelligence and general person implicit theories a second time. We found that a greater proportion of disappointments over the course of the last term predicted a marginal shift toward a more incremental theory of intelligence (
          <em>b</em> = .218, 
          <em>t</em> = 1.78, 
          <em>p</em> = .083), whereas a greater proportion of successes over the course of the last term predicted a significant shift toward a more entity theory (
          <em>b</em> = −.312, 
          <em>t</em> = 2.72, 
          <em>p</em> = .01). Because of the small sample size and retrospective nature of these outcomes, this finding should be interpreted with caution, but suggests an important route for future research.
