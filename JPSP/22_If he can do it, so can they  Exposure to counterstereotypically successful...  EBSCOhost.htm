Of note, participants’ automatic inferences were not simply guided by their explicit reasoning (i.e., their beliefs about what these exemplars signify about the state of race relations). Studies 1–3 demonstrated the basic automatic inference effect and provided evidence that such effects unfolded automatically, without intention or awareness. Study 4 replicated the effect in non-race-related domains. Subsequent studies examined what features of exemplars (Studies 5 and 6) and inference makers (Studies 7 and 8) prompt automatic inferences. Study 5 suggested that counterstereotypically successful exemplars prompt racism-denying inferences because they signal what is possible, even if not typical. Study 6 demonstrated that when these exemplars succeed in a stereotypical domain (e.g., Blacks in athletics), similar automatic inferences are not drawn. Those most likely to draw automatic inferences are people predisposed to approach the world with inferential thinking: participants dispositionally high in need for cognition (Study 7) or experimentally primed to think inferentially (Study 8).

Consider comedian George Burns, who had a daily cigar habit until his death at 100. Although one might argue that Burns’s longevity signifies the exaggerated nature of the danger posed by tobacco, with more thought, one may conclude that Burns stands out as such a notable example because he is such an exception to the rule. Such exemplars have power because, at first glance, they challenge conventional beliefs. Although James Buchanan was America’s first left-handed president, this fact may strike readers as less notable than Obama’s political success or Burns’s longevity, likely because there is little grounds to even suspect an anti-left-handed social climate.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In the present article, we document and examine how exemplars can change people’s beliefs about the context in which those exemplars exist. For most of our studies, we examine the impact of incidental exposure to counterstereotypically successful Black exemplars like Brown University president Ruth Simmons, Fortune 75 CEO Kenneth Frazier, or American President Barack Obama. We ask whether incidental exposure to such exemplars prompts automatic inferences about the state of race relations in modern America.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">This article focuses on automatic inferences, the conclusions people draw following incidental exposure to an exemplar. These inferences need not be (and as our data will show, actually are not) connected to explicit beliefs about what conclusions the exemplars should or do inspire. In fact, we will find that these automatic inferences unfold outside of awareness. But first, if people do draw automatic inferences from counterstereotypically successful exemplars, what inferences are those likely to be and who is likely to draw them?</p><a id="psp-106-3-359-EMDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_8" title="Automatic Inference Despite Explicit Rejection?">Automatic Inference Despite Explicit Rejection?</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Upon exposure to a counterstereotypically successful exemplar, what do people automatically infer? Do Ruth Simmons and Barack Obama stand out because of their race, prompting a reminder of the continued impact of racial prejudice? Or are even single, atypical exemplars enough to prompt an inference that Black success is possible, thereby fueling a sense that continuing racial disparities must be due to shortcomings within the Black community rather than due to the persistence of racism? We reason by analogy from previous research in the social comparison literature to predict that the automatic inferences may reflect the latter pattern.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">When people are exposed to especially successful others, they observe what is possible (
        Taylor &amp; Lobel, 1989). Although such exposure is sometimes inspiring for the self (
        Collins, 1996; 
        Lockwood &amp; Kunda, 1997), these exceptional exemplars can also have a perverse deflating effect because of the information they implicitly communicate (
        Taylor &amp; Levin, 1976; 
        Wood, Taylor, &amp; Lichtman, 1985). For example, breast cancer patients who are exposed to “supercopers”—women who are portrayed as experiencing a relatively burdenless bout with breast cancer—may see that such successful coping is possible, take into consideration their own inferior coping, and thus question their own personal adequacy (
        Taylor &amp; Levin, 1976; 
        Wood et al., 1985). That is, exposure to the “supercoper” leads patients to think that coping with breast cancer is not that hard. Might there be an analogous effect with social perception?
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">To extend the analogy, Black exemplars who are successful in domains that are dominated by White individuals show that such success is possible, which may prompt people to think that constraints created by racial injustices are not that strong. And given the automaticity with which social comparison consequences are known to unfold for the self (
        Mussweiler, Rüter, &amp; Epstude, 2004) and with which causal inferences are made (
        Hassin, Bargh, &amp; Uleman, 2002), such inferences might be arrived at automatically—unfolding unintentionally and outside of awareness. Although these exemplars in theory could prompt the opposite inference (e.g., the surprise one experiences at seeing a counterstereotypically successful Black exemplar could highlight racism’s persistence), this complex pathway seemed less likely to be pursued automatically. After all, previous research reinforces a theme that intuitive or automatic judgments are influenced by the content of specific anecdotes instead of deeper information that speaks to the diagnosticity or relevance of such case-based evidence (e.g., 
        Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1972). If people do consider the opposite inference, it would seem more likely to be done upon explicit reflection, when they can better consider the significance of having experienced surprise at seeing the counterstereotypically successful exemplar.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Whether or how much the presence of one or two counterstereotypical exemplars 
        <em>should</em> shift people’s beliefs is a difficult normative question that is beyond the scope of this article. That said, we can ask whether people respond to incidental exposure to such exemplars in a way that is consistent with their explicit inferences on the matter. If automatic inferences diverge from what inferences participants think the exemplars should or do prompt, we can more conclusively identify automatic inference as a distinct, notable, and unintended judgment effect.

We predict that those predisposed to spontaneously approach stimuli in a highly thoughtful way—that is, seeing the exemplar not merely as a person but as a possible source of information or basis for inference—are most likely to draw automatic inferences.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Typically, being thoughtful and deliberate has been assumed to insulate people from cognitive bias, because many errors in judgment are assumed to occur because people are just not thinking hard enough (
        Strack, Schwarz, Bless, Kubler, &amp; Wänke, 1993). Among many such examples, those high in need for cognition (NFC) make more similar probability estimates in prospect and in hindsight (
        Verplanken &amp; Pieters, 1988), are less sensitive to some framing effects (
        Chatterjee, Heath, Milberg, &amp; France, 2000; 
        Smith &amp; Levin, 1996; cf. 
        LeBoeuf &amp; Shafir, 2003), and are less likely to show the fundamental attribution error (
        D’Agostino &amp; Fincherkiefer, 1992). But thought alone may not immunize people from having their judgments be led astray (
        Forgas, 1995). Ironically, the same characteristics that push people to engage in effortful thought and successfully recognize salient biasing factors upon reflection can also lead those individuals to be more susceptible to subtle biasing factors (
        Petty, DeMarree, Briñol, Horcajo &amp; Strathman, 2008; 
        Petty &amp; Jarvis, 1996). “Many such contaminating effects occur under the most thoughtful situations and for the most thoughtful people, because subtle contaminants can influence cognition without awareness, and the more cognitions one has, the more bias that can occur” (
        Petty, 2001, p. 130). A variety of findings show how added thought can exaggerate bias. Those experimentally prompted or dispositionally inclined to think more are more likely to be influenced by an incidental emotion, a bodily response, a comparison standard, or a subtle prime (
        Briñol &amp; Petty, 2003; 
        Forgas, 1995; 
        Mussweiler, 2003; 
        Petty et al., 2008; 
        Petty, Schumann, Richman, &amp; Strathman, 1993).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Drawing on this tradition, we suggest that a propensity for added thought can predispose one to an automatic inference. But we also predict that the same NFC that may predispose one to automatic inference-making may also lead one to be more skeptical about the underlying logic of such an inference when reflecting on it explicitly. That is, when asked whether these exemplars provide meaningful information, those high in NFC may, if anything, be most inclined to say no. Such findings would help elucidate who shows automatic inference effects and reinforce that automatic inferences neither stem from nor are justified by explicit reasoning or beliefs.</p><a id="psp-106-3-359-EKDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_19" title="Available Evidence">Available Evidence</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Barack Obama offers one recent example of a counterstereotypically successful Black exemplar. Although our focus is not on Barack Obama per se, several recent investigations provide support for our broader hypothesis by examining differences in people’s beliefs before and after Obama’s election. Comparing sentiments just after to just before Obama’s 2008 victory, 
        Kaiser, Drury, Spalding, Cheryan, and O’Brien (2009) found that people saw America as further along the trajectory of racial progress. In a similar pre-election/post-election design, a nationally representative sample of Americans perceived less discrimination against Blacks and became less supportive of some (but not all) racialized political issues (
        Valentino &amp; Brader, 2011). These declines were more pronounced for conservatives than liberals. Although intriguing, this nonexperimental evidence is unlikely to reflect automatic inferences following incidental exposure to exemplars, but instead to reflect explicit assessments of the election’s significance as influenced by media narratives, social conversations, and internal dialogue.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Our investigation is most similar to recent research from 
        Lybarger and Monteith (2011). In two experiments, they had participants create race-related taglines for a magazine cover featuring Obama, Oprah Winfrey, or a nature scene. Those who generated a catchy race-related appeal for Obama or Oprah subsequently showed higher scores on a symbolic racism scale than those who created a (non-race-related) tagline for the nature scene. Although we believe Lybarger and Monteith’s findings help make our predictions—in particular, the direction of the automatic inference (cf. 
        Bodenhausen, Schwarz, Bless, &amp; Wänke, 1995)—more plausible, there are at least four important differences between their focus and the present one.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">First, 
        Lybarger and Monteith (2011) noted that their research does not identify what factors are responsible for their observed shifts. The present article examines hypotheses about the nature of the incidental exemplars, as well as the inference makers themselves, to understand what prompts automatic inferences in whom and exactly when such inferences temporally occur. For instance, whereas 
        Lybarger and Monteith (2011) noted that antiegalitarian attitudes may result from priming “highly successful Black exemplars” (p. 651), our account and studies emphasize that only counterstereotypical success should signal reduced racial disadvantage. Second, Lybarger and Monteith’s participants were explicitly prompted to include “Black” as well as positive adjectives in their taglines. Thus, after identifying a person by race and generating a positive tagline, participants may have felt morally licensed to express racist sentiments (
        Effron, Camerson, &amp; Monin, 2009). Third, we generalize our investigation to non-race-related exemplars that achieve in spite of what would seem to be limiting factors. Fourth, we assess whether automatic inferences unfold automatically, without intention or awareness.

In each study, participants were incidentally exposed to exemplars by way of a quiz that was supposedly part of a different study. In Studies 1–3 and 5–8, the exemplars were a collection of relatively famous exemplars that included either only White people or one or two Black counterstereotypically successful individuals as well. We used a variety of measures to test whether this incidental exposure made people less likely to believe that racial disadvantages persist: denial of racism (Studies 1, 3, 5–7), questions used in major public opinion polls (Study 2), a version of 
        McConahay’s (1986)Modern Racism Scale (Studies 2, 5, 8), and 
        Kaiser et al.’s (2009) policies that address racial inequality scale (Study 5). To generalize our findings, Study 4 tested whether non-race-related, counterstereotypically successful exemplars prompted analogous automatic inferences. Notably, we hypothesized that automatic inferences would be independent of participants’ explicit reasoning about these exemplars (Studies 1–2, 4–5, 7), would occur outside of their awareness (Study 2), and would unfold automatically despite being their being asked to be mindful of the possible influence of the exemplar primes on their stated beliefs (Study 3).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We further tested our theoretical account by examining what features of exemplars (Studies 5 and 6) and inference makers (Studies 7 and 8) prompt automatic inferences. In Study 5, we tested whether counterstereotypically successful exemplars prompt automatic inferences because they signal what is possible, not what is typical. In Study 6, we tested whether exemplars would no longer prompt automatic inferences when they were stereotypically successful. In Study 7, we tested whether high need for cognition individuals are those most likely to draw automatic inferences. In Study 8, we procedurally primed some participants to think inferentially before they were exposed to the exemplars. We predicted that a propensity for thought—whether chronic or experimentally induced—would encourage automatic inferences.</p><a id="psp-106-3-359-EIDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_28" title="Study 1">Study 1</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Our primary aim in Study 1 was to test whether incidental exposure to counterstereotypically successful Black exemplars (Oprah Winfrey and Barack Obama), as opposed to matched White controls, would change participants’ beliefs about race in America. We hypothesized that after exposure to the Black (vs. White) exemplars, participants would be more likely to deny that racism exists as a source of racial disadvantage in modern America. We varied the tone of these denial of racism measures to be worded 
        <em>carefully</em> (i.e., in a way that agreeing with them would not be clearly racist) or 
        <em>bluntly</em> (i.e., in a less cautious manner). Although our reasoning does not predict moderation, the manipulation allowed us to assess the robustness of any effect (i.e., to determine whether automatic inferences might only emerge when participants felt particularly comfortable expressing their beliefs).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In addition, we offered a first test of whether automatic inferences are distinct from participants’ explicit reasoning about the exemplars’ significance by asking participants to explicitly consider what the Black exemplars signified. Several tests assessed whether their explicit reasoning about the exemplars might underlie any automatic inference observed.</p><a id="psp-106-3-359-EBIDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Participants and design</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Participants were 64 undergraduates at Cornell University. Those who participated in Study 1, as well as all subsequent studies, did not self-identify as Black (even in part). Participants were randomly assigned to one of four conditions in a 2 (prime: Black or White) × 2 (tone: blunt or careful) between-subjects design.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Procedure and materials</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In this study (and all subsequent studies), the priming task and dependent measures were presented as though they were two separate studies. In order to enhance the believability of this cover story, the priming task was completed on a computer, whereas the dependent measures were included in a stapled packet.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><em>Exemplar priming task</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Participants were told they were completing a “Celebrity Recognition Task” that was a pretest for another study. On each of six trials, participants were shown two photos. For each of 6 exemplars, participants were asked to indicate (or guess) which photo was a specified celebrity (see 
              Figure 1). In the 
              <em>Black</em> condition, two of the exemplars were African Americans who had succeeded in counterstereotypical domains: Barack Obama and Oprah Winfrey. The study was conducted after Obama was the official Democratic presidential nominee but before he was the president-elect. In the 
              <em>White</em> condition, these two Black exemplars were replaced with Alec Baldwin and Barbara Walters. Obama’s White “match” was a liberal television personality instead of a liberal politician for fear that any mention of a Democratic politician would immediately call to mind Barack Obama. In both conditions, participants saw the other 4 White exemplars: Kyle Busch, John Grisham, Heidi Klum, and Kelly Pavlik. Each question briefly explained who the celebrity was (e.g., “Which person is talk show host Oprah Winfrey?” “… Barbara Walters?”). The two options were always of the same race, so even if participants did not know the celebrity, they would know his or her race.

We created two versions. In one, we worded the items in a very careful tone, hoping to minimize self-presentation concerns. We began by including instructions that suggested that African American leaders disagree about whether the gap between Black and White communities is due to problems within the Black community or to continued racism (see 
              Appendix A for the instructions and scale). We hoped these instructions would give participants permission to express their honest responses. Participants then responded to five questions on 1- to 10-point scales (e.g., “Many, if not most, people truly wish that we lived in a world where the color of one’s skin was of no consequence. Clearly there remain disparities between the races in terms of outcomes, but to what extent do you think that we may have achieved the goal of true equality of opportunity among the races? from 1 [
              <em>not at all</em>] to 10 [
              <em>completely</em>].”).
            </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">With the carefully toned items, we went to great lengths to ensure that participants would be willing to endorse beliefs that could sound racially insensitive. At the same time, our findings would not be particularly robust if they emerged only in these artificial circumstances. As such, we also created blunt items. We removed the opening passage suggesting that even African American leaders disagreed on these issues and modified each question to remove the language that would help to justify denying racial disadvantage. For example, the blunt item about equality of opportunity omitted the opening statements that expressed a concern for an egalitarian society and removed the noncommittal phrase that we “may have” achieved equality of opportunity. The item simply read, “Do you think we have already achieved the goal of true equality of opportunity among the races?” The scales were reliable (blunt: α = .80; careful: α = .76).</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><em>Political orientation</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In an effort to control for a baseline source of variation in the denial of racism, we included two items that measured participants’ political orientation.

              <em>Republican/conservative</em>). The items were highly correlated,

              <em>does help support this idea</em>). We labeled the midpoint, 4 (
              <em>unsure/could go either way</em>). Note that we decided against measuring this variable in advance (e.g., on a pretest or counterbalanced with our denial of racism scale) so participants would not be alerted to the focus of our study before completing the key denial of racism measure.

First, on average, participants tended to disagree that the presence of African Americans such as Obama and Winfrey lends support to the idea that racism is not what holds Blacks back: The mean response, 3.59 (
            <em>SD</em> = 1.54), was significantly less than the midpoint of 4.00, 
            <em>t</em>(63) = 2.11, 
            <em>p</em> = .04, 
            <em>d</em> = .27. Although this is not a necessary condition to establish the distinctness of automatic inferences, this fact alone makes the dissociation likely.
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Second, we tested whether the Black exemplar primes caused people to shift their denial of racism to be more in line with their explicit beliefs about the exemplars’ significance. Although participants’ explicit judgments about the significance of the exemplars for race relations correlated—not surprisingly—with their denial of racism, 
            <em>r</em>(62) = .55, 
            <em>p</em> &lt; .001, this correlation was constant across the conditions (
            <em>t</em> &lt; 1). If the explicit analysis of what exemplars signified explained the automatic inference, it would need to more strongly predict denial of racism in the Black (vs. White) priming condition.
            <a id="b-fn2"> </a><sup /> Note that one strength of this strong correlation is it helps to speak against an alternative explanation that the explicit endorsement item was too confusing or, as a single item, too unreliable to predict anything.
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Third, we found that participants’ political orientation predicted their explicit beliefs about the exemplars’ significance but did not moderate the automatic inference effect. Participants’ conservatism predicted their endorsement of the claim that Obama and Winfrey support the idea that racism is not what holds African Americans back, 
            <em>r</em>(62) = .36, 
            <em>p</em> = .004. But political orientation did not moderate the automatic inference effects (
            <em>t</em> &lt; 1). That is, liberal and conservative participants were equally influenced by exposure to the Black primes. (Note that this lack of moderation by political ideology, which will be replicated later, is in contrast with earlier research on Obama’s election that we argued was likely not driven by automatic inferences; 
            Valentino &amp; Brader, 2011). In combination, these three analyses suggest that participants’ explicit beliefs about what Obama and Winfrey symbolize neither supported automatic inferences nor played a role in forming them.

First, we aimed to replicate our effect using new counterstereotypically successful Black exemplar primes: Fortune 75 CEO Kenneth Frazier and Brown University president Ruth Simmons. Second, we assessed participants’ beliefs about the state of racial progress by relying on previously used measures: polling questions from CNN and Gallup and a modified Modern Racism Scale (
        McConahay, 1986). Third, we modified the measures of explicit endorsement used to test whether these inferences unfold automatically. Study 1 tested whether automatic inferences complied with participants’ own explicit interpretation (i.e., what participants believed the exemplars signified). But perhaps participants rejected the idea that, normatively, the exemplars support the conclusion that there is less racism even as they were well aware that exposure to the exemplars did explicitly remind them of racism’s decline. Thus, in Study 2, we asked what conclusions about race relations the exemplars reminded participants of. We also assessed whether participants were aware that exposure to the exemplars affected their perceptions that racism is increasing or declining.

First, we looked to public opinion polling that has tried to capture Americans’ beliefs about the status of racial progress in America. We modified three questions—from an August 2011 
              <em>USA Today/</em>Gallup poll and a May 2010 CNN/Opinion Research Corp Poll—for use as Likert-type measures: “Do you think new Civil Rights laws are needed to reduce discrimination against Blacks, or not?” (1 = 
              <em>are not needed,</em> 7 = 
              <em>are needed</em>); “How much of a role, if any, do you think the government 
              <em>needs</em> to have in trying to improve the social and economic position of Blacks and other minority groups in this country?” (1 = 
              <em>major role,</em> 4 = 
              <em>minor role,</em> 7 = 
              <em>no role</em>); and “To what extent do you think we are in a new era of perfect race relations in this country, or do you think that we remain in a time in which the promises of racial progress are far ahead of us?” (1 = 
              <em>promises of racial progress far ahead of us,</em> 7 = 
              <em>new era already</em>). After reverse-scoring the first item, we averaged the three into a single public opinion polling, racism-denying composite (α = .59). A factor analysis showed that all three items loaded on a single factor (λs &gt; .65), suggesting the moderate-to-low reliability was mostly a function of the short length of the scale instead of a lack of singularity of the measures. When relatively low reliability takes this form, the primary concern is that it makes analyses particularly conservative, given that the impact of random error on individual items is less easily cancelled out by random error from other items.
            </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Second, participants completed a modified version of the seven-item Modern Racism Scale (
              McConahay, 1986). Although we left some items untouched (e.g., “Discrimination against Blacks is no longer a major problem in the United States”), we reverse-worded or modified some of the items in order to make them less inflammatory or more reasonable by current standards (e.g., “Blacks have more influence upon school desegregation plans than they ought to have” became “Blacks have less influence on national policy than they ought to”). This scale had good reliability (α = .78). Modern or symbolic racism scales measure people’s perceptions of the presence and causes of racial disadvantage (
              McConahay &amp; Hough, 1976). As 
              Tetlock (1994) noted, items on such symbolic racism scales could be endorsed for multiple reasons. As the example items indicate, they could be endorsed because one believes that Blacks no longer face racism (or face less than they used to)—what we hope to measure—or because of anti-Black prejudice. Given that previous research has shown that exposure to liked, successful Black exemplars has a neutral or positive effect on attitudes toward Blacks (
              Columb &amp; Plant, 2011; 
              Plant et al., 2009), this suggests that any increase in agreement with the modern racism items items would most likely reflect the dispassionate belief that race is not a limiting factor in modern America. The two race-related dependent measures were highly correlated, 
              <em>r</em>(164) = .54, 
              <em>p</em> &lt; .001. We conduct tests on a composite of the measures as well as each individual measure.

All participants were first told that “Kenneth Frazier is the CEO of an American Fortune 75 company. He is African American. Ruth Simmons is the president of an Ivy League university. She is African American.” Participants were then prompted with “Does learning or being reminded of the existence of Kenneth Frazier and Ruth Simmons …” followed by three statements. These appeared in a random order: “… not really remind me of any particular conclusion about the discrimination-related experience of Blacks in modern America” (
              <em>no race-related reminder</em>); “… remind me that Blacks do not face many hurdles due to discrimination in modern America” (
              <em>reminder of denial of racism</em>); and “… remind me that Blacks continue to face substantial hurdles due to discrimination in modern America” (
              <em>reminder of presence of racism</em>). For each item, participants responded on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (
              <em>definitely no</em>) to 7 (
              <em>definitely yes</em>), with 4 explicitly labeled “neither yes nor no.”

Participants considered three ways the celebrity recognition task might have changed the subsequently measured beliefs: “A: Felt more strongly that Blacks could get ahead if only they tried harder, that race is not a limiting factor”; “B: Did not change my beliefs. The opinions I expressed about race were those I already had”; or “C: Felt more strongly that Blacks continue to face discrimination in this country, that equality is a distant hope.” Participants responded on a 9-point scale with labels at 1 (
              <em>Purely A</em>), 5 (
              <em>B: Didn’t change my beliefs</em>), and 9 (

            <em>SD</em> = 1.61), 
            <em>t</em> &lt; 1. Last, participants explicitly disagreed with the idea that the exemplars reminded them of a lack of racism (

Participants in the warned-Black prime condition were told about the upcoming measure about race in America and were asked to consider the relevance of the Black exemplars they would soon see when formulating their responses to those measures. It was stressed to them they might have three different responses to the exemplars. These responses were articulated with the same wording as the explicit measures in Study 2—that the exemplars could remind participants that racism persists, remind them that racism is on the decline, or not remind them of either conclusion. Participants were encouraged to be mindful of their own reactions to the exemplars in forming answers to the subsequent race-related measures. Recall that in Study 2, participants indicated explicitly that the exemplars did not remind them of any particular racial conclusion, even though their responses on the race-related measures suggested that they had automatically inferred that racism is on the decline. Participants in the (nonwarned) Black and White priming conditions received instructions that were matched in length and style but focused only on the recognition task (e.g., “Viewing them could: 1) Remind you of their last names immediately …”). The rest of the task was identical to that outlined in Study 2.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><em>Denial of racism</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Given that the tone (blunt vs. careful) did not moderate effects in Study 1, we used only the carefully worded, five-item denial of racism measure from Study 1 (α = .84).</p><a id="psp-106-3-359-EAGDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Results and Discussion</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We submitted our denial of racism index to a one-way ANCOVA, with modern racism scores from the pretest as a covariate (in this and all subsequent analyses).

Participants in Studies 1 and 2 showed no indication that they explicitly endorsed or were even aware of the automatic inferences that they drew. Consistent with these results, warning participants about the connection between the primes and the denial of racism scale did not disrupt the effect, suggesting that it occurred unintentionally and outside of awareness. These results speak against an alternative explanation that participants intentionally draw automatic inferences but disguise their responses on items that more easily tag them as racists. The warning manipulation should have ignited self-presentational concerns on the denial of racism measure; thus, the alternative account predicts a disruption of the automatic inference effect. Instead, the more parsimonious conclusion is that participants are neither aware of nor intend the inferences (i.e., they are automatic).</p><a id="psp-106-3-359-EFDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_95" title="Study 4">Study 4</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Despite consistent findings in the first three studies, two questions about the generality of automatic inferences remain. First, would these effects replicate in a non-race-related domain? Participants in Study 4 were incidentally exposed to exemplars that achieved success in different forms despite having characteristics that might be assumed to hold them back (e.g., a CEO who spent two hours a day on a social networking site). Much as our first three studies tested to what extent being African American was seen as an achievement-inhibiting factor, we assessed participants’ beliefs about the extent to which the identified features were similarly inhibiting.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Second, would we continue to see a dissociation between automatic inferences and explicit inferences about what the exemplars imply? Perhaps the domain of race is unique in the amount of caution people exercise in agreeing that an exemplar’s success suggests fewer limitations for others. Study 3 addressed this concern in one way. If Study 4 finds an automatic-explicit dissociation in less prickly domains, we would have more confidence that participants were not simply misrepresenting their explicit beliefs about the Black exemplars’ significance.</p><a id="psp-106-3-359-ECFDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Participants were 39 students at the University of Chicago who participated in exchange for $3. Participants were randomly assigned to a 
            <em>counterstereotypical</em> or 
            <em>stereotypical</em> exemplar priming condition.
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Materials and procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">First, participants completed an exemplar priming task framed as a trivia task. Through it, participants were exposed to three exemplars who succeeded, in some cases despite factors that would be expected to inhibit success. To measure automatic inferences, we asked participants to make judgments related to these potentially success-inhibiting factors. The final measures probed participants’ normative beliefs about how learning of the exemplars should influence their beliefs.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><em>Exemplar priming task</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Six questions were equivalent for everyone. The remaining three varied by condition. For those in the counterstereotypical exemplar condition, each such question alluded to an exemplar that was meant to be surprising given most people’s prior beliefs or stereotypes. The examples conflicted with the broad beliefs that fast food is unhealthy, that social networking sites interfere with productivity, and that China has poor labor practices. More specifically, the fast food item asked participants at which restaurant the oldest living Californian eats every day, McDonald’s or Wendy’s. The social networking item read, “According to Fortune 500 CEO Ronald N. Turner, he spends two hours a day on what social networking website?” The choices were Facebook and My Space. The factory item asked which factory was rated the most labor-friendly factory in the world. The choices were two factories located in China. Participants randomly assigned to the stereotypical condition were given three matched questions that were not designed to be surprising (e.g., “According to Fortune 500 CEO Ronald N. Turner, he spends two hours a day reading which print publication? 
              <em>New York Times</em> or 
              <em>Wall Street Journal</em>”).
            </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><em>Opinion survey</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Participants then completed a supposedly unrelated 18-item opinion survey that asked three questions about each of six different topics. Three topics were fillers (e.g., reality television). Participants’ responses on the three critical topics (fast food: α = .65, social networking websites: α = .57, and China’s labor practices: α = .43) served as our primary measures of automatic inferences. For example, one fast food item asked, “To what extent do you believe that the obesity and heart disease epidemic in America is due to fast food restaurants?” One social networking item asked, “Do you think that most people spend too much time on Facebook for their own good?” One China item asked, “To what extent do you think that depressed life-spans in China (more than 5 years less than those in the U.S.) are the fault of poor labor conditions versus poor nutrition?” In this way, much as with our race-related studies, we tested whether participants made inferences that a factor was not success inhibiting following a single example showing the factor did not inevitably thwart “success.” Each item was measured on a 10-point scale with different relevant endpoints (see 
              Appendix B for the full set of measures).
            </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><em>Explicit endorsement of exemplars’ significance</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Finally, we assessed how participants believed they 
              <em>should</em> change their beliefs in response to each exemplar. By asking what conclusions participants should draw, we could more conclusively test whether automatic inferences—which we already know occur outside of participants’ awareness—are inconsistent with participants’ explicit normative standards. Although behavior may depart from people’s own prescriptions because such behavior is effortful to carry out (e.g., dieting), such excuses do not readily apply to questions of logical inference. Instead, a dissociation would further support our characterization of automatic inference as unintended and distinct from explicit inference.
            </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">All participants saw the counterstreotypical exemplars, some for the first time. Although the wording was specific to each item, participants were to indicate to what extent the exemplar should push them toward (A) the counterstereotypical conclusion (e.g., “push me toward believing that Facebook and other social networking sites do not interfere with worker productivity given that is what the example suggests”), (B) no particular conclusion (e.g., “does not provide information about whether Facebook and other social networking sites interfere with worker productivity”), or (C) the opposite conclusion, given how surprising the example is (e.g., “strengthen my belief that Facebook and other social networking sites interfere with worker productivity given how surprising the example is”). Participants responded on a 1 (
              <em>completely</em> A) to 7 (
              <em>completely</em> C) scale. The midpoint, 4, was labeled 
              <em>B</em>.

As predicted, participants in the counterstereotypical exemplar condition were more likely to state beliefs that served to minimize the concerns to which the examples related (
            <em>M</em> = 0.19, 
            <em>SD</em> = 0.56) compared to those in the stereotypical exemplar condition (
            <em>M</em> = −0.18, 
            <em>SD</em> = 0.48), 
            <em>t</em>(37) = 2.26, 
            <em>p</em> = .03, 
            <em>d</em> = .74: Following counterstereotypical (vs. stereotypical) exposure, participants reported social networking to be less of a productivity drain, fast food to be less of a health threat, and China’s labor practices to be less bad. The inference effect did not vary by exemplar (
            <em>F</em> &lt; 1).

We examined participants’ explicit reports for what information they believed should be taken from each of the three surprising examples. We reverse-scored participants’ responses to the explicit items so responses above 4 would indicate explicit agreement with the automatic inferences; responses below 4 would indicate a belief that the surprising nature of the exemplar should further strengthen one’s stereotypical belief.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Next, we averaged participants’ responses to form an index reflecting normative endorsement of the automatic inferences’ underlying logic. The mean rating for the examples was 3.27, which was significantly lower than the midpoint of 4, 
            <em>t</em>(37) = −4.67, 
            <em>p</em> &lt; .001, 
            <em>d</em> = .76. Participants explicitly rejected the logic of the automatic inference in each domain (social networking: 
            <em>M</em> = 3.55, fast food: 
            <em>M</em> = 3.18, and China: 
            <em>M</em> = 3.08;

            <em>p</em>s &lt; .05, 
            <em>d</em>s &gt; .32). Finally, as in Studies 1–2, participants’ responses to the opinion survey were no more in line with their explicit analysis of the counterstereotypical exemplars in the counterstereotypical versus the stereotypical exemplar condition (
            <em>t</em> &lt; 1), providing fuller support for the dissociation.

In addition to establishing the generality of the automatic effect, the findings are important for two reasons. First, whereas participants may have been exposed to public discussions about whether counterstereotypically successful exemplars such as Barack Obama signaled a post-racial America, participants would not have heard similar discussions about the fictitious exemplars we created. As 
          Kawakami, Dovidio, and Dijksterhuis (2003) noted, mere knowledge of a proposition endorsed by others can contribute to its being activated and affecting cognition, even when it is not explicitly endorsed. Our reliance on fictitious exemplars shows that participants are not merely parroting others’ narratives.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Second, the present results give us more confidence that automatic inferences are not justified by explicit reasoning. Although it was possible in Studies 1–2 that participants were reluctant to adopt an explicit stance that might come off as racially insensitive, the same pressures were minimized in the present study.</p><a id="psp-106-3-359-EEDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_120" title="Study 5">Study 5</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Study 5 extended the previous studies in two ways. First, we used a new dependent measure. In addition to the denial of racism scale and the modified Modern Racism Scale used in previous studies, we added 
        Kaiser et al.’s (2009) policies that address racial inequality scale. Second, Study 5 included a third condition that permitted us to distinguish between two explanations for what counterstereotypically successful exemplars signal. We have argued that counterestereotypically successful exemplars signal that success is possible. An alternative possibility is that such exemplars suggest that there must be many other examples (i.e., that such success is typical). For example, in research on subtyping (
        Kunda &amp; Oleson, 1995; 
        Maurer, Park, &amp; Rothbart, 1995; 
        Richards &amp; Hewstone, 2001), exemplars judged to be unrepresentative are mentally segregated and are not used to draw inferences about their group (
        Park, Wolsko, &amp; Judd, 2001).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">To distinguish these possibilities, we added a third condition. In this 
        <em>Black-atypical</em> condition, Frazier was identified as the only Fortune 75 Black CEO and Simmons was identified as the first Black Ivy League president. If the exemplars prompt automatic inferences because they show success is possible (even if not typical), the Black-atypical condition should still prompt automatic inferences. If the exemplars prompt automatic inferences because they imply such success is typical, the automatic inference effect should be reduced in the Black-atypical condition. Given it is unlikely that Study 1 participants thought Barack Obama was one of many Black presidents, we expected that atypical Blacks would prompt similar automatic inferences.

            <em>M</em> = 3.49, 
            <em>SD</em> = 1.51), 
            <em>t</em>(463) = −7.24, 
            <em>p</em> &lt; .001, 
            <em>d</em> = .34, and the idea that the exemplars suggested it was more reasonable to conclude that disadvantage due to racism continued (

            <em>p</em>s &lt; .01, 
            <em>d</em>s &gt; .24). Again, it is notable that the inference participants indicated was least appropriate was precisely the one they had just automatically drawn.
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Did participants’ explicitly endorsed inferences explain how those primed with the Black exemplars shifted their beliefs? As we had in Study 2, we subtracted participants’ explicit belief that the exemplars were nondiagnostic from their explicit belief that the exemplars supported a denial of racism. We found this composite did not interact with priming condition to predict race-related beliefs, 
            <em>t</em>(432) = −1.39, 
            <em>p</em> &gt; .16,

          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">As in Study 1, more conservative participants were more likely to explicitly state that the exemplars supported a denial of racism (vs. were nondiagnostic), 
            <em>r</em>(462) = .33, 
            <em>p</em> &lt; .001. But participants’ political orientation did not moderate the focal contrast that tested our key automatic inference effect (
            <em>t</em> &lt; 1). In other words, although ideology influenced explicit inferences, it did not influence the automatic inference that was prompted by incidental exposure.

Participants exposed to counterstereotypically successful Black exemplars were more likely to deny racism, be less supportive of policies that address racial inequality, and give higher responses on a modern racism scale. The same participants, however, indicated that the exemplars should not encourage any particular conclusion about the state of racial progress in America.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In addition, the results supported our account that exemplars prompt automatic inferences because they demonstrate that success is possible, not because those exemplars are assumed to be typical (i.e., one of many Black exemplars) in their category: Counterstereotypically successful Black exemplars prompted automatic inferences regardless of whether those exemplars were explicitly identified as “the first” or “only” African Americans in those positions. Thus, these automatic inference effects seem not to reflect the mere process of induction, by which people attempt to generalize the experience of one to understand the typical experience of many. Mere induction effects are sensitive to typicality manipulations (
          Heit, 2000; 
          Mastropasqua, Crupi, &amp; Tentori, 2010; 
          Rips, 1975). Instead, the exemplars demonstrate that the deck is not inevitably stacked against these exemplars. Although this “existence proof” is not enough to convince people explicitly that the exemplars reflect meaningful information, the mere demonstration that success is possible—even when it is labeled as atypical—automatically pushes people to be less sympathetic to the idea that Blacks are at a racial disadvantage.

We exposed participants to one of three types of exemplars: counterstereotypically successful Blacks, stereotypically successful Blacks (e.g., athletes or soul singers), or matched White controls. If it is the exemplar’s counterstereotypical success—not the exemplar’s likeability or success more generally—that prompts people to deny racism, then those in the Black-counterstereotypical condition should deny racism as an explanation for inequity more than those in the Black-stereotypical or White control conditions.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">As a secondary aim, we reduced the number of key exemplars to which participants were exposed from two to one.

Earlier, we argued that those who are chronically thoughtful, inferential thinkers are most likely to draw automatic inferences. Such individuals may automatically respond to the exemplars in the priming task not merely as people to be identified but as possible sources of information. Guided by related research on conceptual priming, we identified these people with a need for cognition scale (
        Cacioppo, Petty, &amp; Kao, 1984). Because college students tend to be high in NFC, we worried that we might run up against a ceiling effect by relying on a college student sample. As such, we drew participants from the community. Our main hypothesis was that the automatic inference effect would emerge to the extent that participants were high in their NFC.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">An alternative hypothesis is that the automatic inference effects reflect a form of motivated reasoning. That is, perhaps for some individuals—those who have racist inklings—incidental exposure to counterstereotypically successful exemplars gives them permission to express somewhat racist sentiments that they would otherwise hide. It is hard to imagine though that many of the participants had been waiting to support the labor-friendly nature of China but had not felt comfortable doing so (Study 4), or that participants would feel licensed to draw automatic inferences but not shift their explicit beliefs about those exemplars’ significance in a parallel way (Studies 1–2, 4–5). Nonetheless, we measured on a web-based pretest—in addition to NFC—participants’ motivation to avoid prejudice and their responses on the Modern Racism Scale to assess whether they moderated the automatic inference effect.

One statement articulated explicitly the automatic inference that participants drew in Studies 1–3 and 5–6 and that we thought (at least high NFC) participants would draw automatically in this study: “Her success symbolizes or reflects that racism is not what holds African Americans back in today’s world.” The other statement articulated the opposing perspective: “It is the rarity of such successful African Americans that makes her notable, and this demonstrates the continued presence of racism.” Each was measured on a 9-point scale with 1 (

            <em>SD</em> = 1.95), not that racism is on the decline (

Of course, it could be that the two statements were stated in differentially persuasive terms, so it is important to test the automatic-explicit dissociation with additional analyses. And indeed, as found in Studies 1–2 and 4–5, there was no indication that participants’ denial of racism drew on participants’ explicit analysis of the Black exemplars’ significance following incidental exposure to them. That is, we created a difference score that reflected a stronger belief that Ruth Simmons’s existence speaks against the continued presence of racism instead of being a reminder of racism’s persistence. The crucial prime × NFC interaction predicting denial of racism did not additionally interact with this difference score (
            <em>t</em> &lt; 1).
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">To further probe the relation between automatic and explicit inference, we tested whether those high in NFC—those most likely to draw an automatic inference denying racism—were also those who agreed that Ruth Simmons carried this significance.

In contrast, it was not the case that either a motivation to avoid prejudice or greater endorsement of items on the Modern Racism Scale produced similar moderation. Thus, it seems not to be the case that our participants’ automatic inferences were motivated effects, or conclusions that those with racist tendencies felt licensed to draw.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Once again, there was no evidence that participants’ automatic inferences were a product of or justified by their explicit reasoning about the exemplar’s significance. In fact, those who were most likely to show the automatic inference effect—those high in NFC—were those most likely to explicitly reject the inference. This dissociation makes an ironic point: The same watchful eye that leads one to be reluctant to embrace the suspect meaning of a single exemplar may also predispose one to be led astray by incidental exposure to the same stimuli. That participants high in NFC were most likely to explicitly reject the automatic inference’s logic reinforces our point that such suspicion is appreciated only upon careful explicit reflection. One fruitful avenue for future research would be to probe whether there are circumstances in which people high in NFC automatically detect the folly of automatic inferences and thereby keep themselves from making them. We are not optimistic. Correcting automatic processes frequently requires effortful, controlled processing (
          Gawronski &amp; Bodenhausen, 2006; 
          Wegener &amp; Petty, 1997), which should be difficult to call upon given that automatic inferences appear to unfold outside of awareness.

By our account, people draw automatic inferences when exposed to the exemplars: Whereas some people simply see a Black Ivy League president or a Black Nobel laureate, others automatically treat these exemplars as possible pieces of information upon which automatic inferences may be based. Thus, we thought that the inferential thinking mindset would lead people to be influenced by the exemplar prime when the inferential mindset manipulation was positioned prior to the exemplar primes. The mindset manipulation should not exacerbate the exemplar priming effect, however, if it occurs after exposure to the exemplars but just prior to the dependent measures.</p><a id="psp-106-3-359-ECBDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Participants and design</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Participants were 111 residents of Berkeley, California, or surrounding communities in the San Francisco Bay area.

Such participants showed higher modern racism scores after exposure to counterstereotypically successful African Americans (Ruth Simmons and Toni Morrison) instead of to White controls. These findings support a process by which thoughtful people draw automatic conclusions about exemplars upon incidental exposure to them.</p><a id="psp-106-3-359-EADA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_215" title="General Discussion">General Discussion</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In considering counterstereotypically successful Black exemplars, people show signs of agreeing and disagreeing with William Bennett’s CNN Election Night interpretation of such success. After incidental exposure to Blacks who had succeeded in counterstereotypical domains, participants showed a tendency to deny racism (Studies 1, 3, 5–7), to agree with public opinion polling (Study 2) and Modern Racism Scale items (Studies 2, 5, 8) that suggest Blacks are no longer seen to be at a racial disadvantage, and to show reduced support for policies to address racial inequality (Study 5). Several features of the data speak to the robustness of these inferences. Participants drew these automatic inferences to several different counterstereotypically successful African Americans (Frazier, Morrison, Obama, Simmons, and Winfrey). Furthermore, automatic inferences emerged in response to two exemplars (Studies 1–3, 5, 8) or just a single exemplar (Studies 4, 6–7), and were not sensitive to how delicately the dependent measures were worded (Study 1). Finally, Study 4 showed that automatic inferences emerge in response to counterstereotypical success, even outside of a racial context. Thus, participants’ automatic inferences match the explicit logic Bennett laid out.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The very same participants, when asked explicitly, however, stated that the exemplars do not reflect the decline of racism (Studies 1, 7), do not even remind participants of racism’s decline (Study 2), and certainly should not be taken as evidence that race (Study 5) or the non-race-related factors (Study 4) are not impediments to success. Additional analyses showed that these explicit perspectives on the exemplars did not underlie the automatic inferences. Liberals and individuals high in NFC were most explicitly skeptical of the logic underlying automatic inferences but were no less (and in the latter case, were more) likely to draw automatic inferences. Furthermore, participants’ automatic inferences unfolded outside of participants’ awareness (Study 2), emerged regardless of whether participants were warned of the connection between the exemplar primes and the key dependent measures (Study 3), and were similarly dissociated from participants’ explicit perspective when the exemplars did not speak to sensitive race-related topics (Study 4). In sum, we found no evidence that automatic inferences unfolded with intention or awareness (see 
        Bargh, 1994).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Did exposure to counterstereotypically successful Blacks increase denial of racism, or did exposure to only Whites decrease it as well? We returned to Studies 2 and 8, in which we had pretest and postmanipulation data on the modified Modern Racism Scale. We looked at how modern racism scores changed across time in those Black prime conditions expected to show, versus matched White prime conditions not expected to show, automatic inferences. To maximize power, we meta-analytically combined across the two studies. As expected, the Black primes increased denial of racism (Stouffer’s 
        <em>Z</em> = 4.30, 
        <em>p</em> &lt; .001). The White primes had no effect (Stouffer’s 
        <em>Z</em> = 0.36, 
        <em>ns</em>).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The studies distinguished between competing accounts of what it is about the exemplars that trigger these automatic inferences. Study 5 showed that counterstereotypically successful exemplars prompt automatic inferences merely by showing that success is possible, even if the achievement is unique or not typical. Study 6 confirmed that it was the counterstereotypical nature of the exemplars’ success, not their status as merely being successful (
        Lybarger &amp; Monteith, 2011), that prompted automatic inferences. We also explored why people draw automatic inferences. We hypothesized that those who are chronically thoughtful may be those who are most likely to draw automatic inferences from incidental exemplars. This was found in studies that relied on individual differences in thoughtfulness (Study 7) and an experimental manipulation of inferential thought (Study 8). Furthermore, Study 8 clarified that automatic inferences are drawn when people are incidentally exposed to the exemplars, not when participants are later asked to state their race-related beliefs.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Although our findings suggest that automatic inferences are not guided by an explicit reasoning process, the dissociation raises the question of when explicit reasoning might shield people from the influence of incidental exemplars. This question is all the more applicable, given evidence that people will spontaneously discount the influence of biasing single exemplars. For example, 
        Oppenheimer (2004) found that people no longer relied on the fluency of a last name as a cue to its frequency when the name was a famous last name (e.g., Bush). In this case, people spontaneously recognized that “Bush” was a special case and thus were not misled (and in fact, overcorrected). But in our Study 3, we found that even those warned that they should consider what the exemplars signaled about racism still drew automatic inferences.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We note two key differences between the present research and Oppenheimer’s. First, participants drew automatic inferences because they signaled what was possible, not typical (Study 5). Thus, information that noted why a specific counterstereotypically successful exemplar was unusual (like a recognition that “Bush” is an unusual case, given the famousness of the name in American politics) might not provide similar grounds for disrupting the effect. If the exemplar was unusual for reasons that suggested success is not possible for other Blacks in America, however, the information could potentially disrupt the automatic inference effect. In other words, subtyping a person as a unique member of a category need not undermine automatic inferences, but subtyping a person’s experience as unrepresentative may block such inferences. But second, Oppenheimer’s participants presumably were aware that they were relying on the familiarity of a last name when assessing its commonness. Because our participants were unaware of drawing automatic inferences, they were unlikely to try to correct for them.</p><a id="psp-106-3-359-EBADA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Relation to Previously Identified Exemplar Effects</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Although we find much of the contribution of the present research to lie in our detailed examination of when and why these automatic inferences emerge, it is worth noting how they are similar to and different from other influences of single instances.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Availability heuristic</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Research on the availability heuristic suggests that people use the ease of recalling an exemplar as a basis for inferring that the exemplar’s category is relatively common. Even on the surface, the present research differs in that we did not measure the estimated frequency of Black success but instead measured assessments of the racial climate. Of course, the availability heuristic might still underlie the automatic inferences we documented: When asked to state their beliefs about race relations in America, people might recruit to mind salient counterstereotypically successful exemplars, use this ease of recall to infer the commonness of such exemplars, and then conclude that racism is no longer a serious problem.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Three features of our data speak against this. First, participants in Study 5 continued to draw automatic inferences when the counterstereotypically successful Black exemplar was labeled as unique, although such information should have disrupted an availability-heuristic-mediated process. Second, the availability heuristic account suggests that people reflect on and draw inferences from the salient exemplars when asked to state their beliefs about race (
            Kahneman, 2003; 
            Kahneman &amp; Frederick, 2002; 
            Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1973). But if so, the inferential priming manipulation in Study 8 should have been as strong (or stronger) when positioned just before the judgment as when positioned just before the exemplar prime. Instead, the inferential thinking prime only heightened automatic inferences when positioned before exemplar primes, suggesting that people draw automatic inferences when they encounter counterstereotypically successful exemplars. Third, people do not rely on the availability heuristic when they see the available exemplar as nondiagnostic of the judgment (
            Oppenheimer, 2004). In contrast, automatic inferences unfolded despite people explicitly viewing the exemplar as nondiagnostic.
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Exemplars shape category knowledge</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">People lean on single exemplars not merely to estimate the size of a category but to understand what defines it. For example, people will categorize new exemplars based on their similarity to exemplars whose category membership is known (
            Medin &amp; Schaffer, 1978; 
            Read, 1983). Similarly, when one piece of information is known about a single exemplar, people will readily ascribe that information to other category members, especially if category homogeneity is assumed (
            López, Gelman, Gutheil, &amp; Smith, 1992; 
            Nisbett, Krantz, Jepson &amp; Kunda, 1983; 
            Osherson, Smith, Wilkie, López, &amp; Shafir, 1990) or the information and group are rare (
            Risen, Gilovich, &amp; Dunning, 2007). The present research does not examine inferences about an exemplar’s category as much as it does the context in which that exemplar operates. Furthermore, these previously studied examples are more defensible and thus may be consistent with people’s explicit reasoning. That is, although assessing the similarity to a single exemplar may not guarantee that one will categorize a novel exemplar accurately, it seems defensible given the informational impoverishment of the context.
          </p><a id="psp-106-3-359-EAADA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Questions for Future Research</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In the present research, participants drew automatic inferences from incidental exposure to specific, identifiable exemplars. According to the inclusion fallacy (
          Osherson et al., 1990; 
          Shafir, Smith, &amp; Osherson, 1990), people are more willing to generalize from an example to all members of a category (from robins to all birds) than from an example to another example in the category (from robins to ostriches). So, although we repeatedly demonstrated an effect of incidental exposure on broad judgments about the general state of race relations in the United States, it is an open question whether people would make similar inferences when judging a single Black individual. For example, after exposure to President Obama, would people be less likely to claim that a particular Black man was passed over for a job because of his race?
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Future research might also test whether exposure to generic Black individuals in business suits, judges’ robes, or medical scrubs produce similar effects. And just as 
          Pachur, Hertwig, and Steinmann (2012) noted that after watching 
          <em>Jaws</em> people might see shark attacks as a more widespread problem, it would be interesting to test whether even fictional depictions of counterstereotypically successful Blacks—for example, in television shows that portray underrepresented minorities in high-status roles—might prompt the automatic inferences documented here. This highlights a related research challenge: how best to present counterstereotypically successful minorities in a way that maximizes their potential to be motivating role models while minimizing the negative automatic inferences shown here. In recent work, 
          Eibach and Purdie-Vaughns (2011) showed that people are less complacent about racial inequality if they consider social progress to be a commitment to racial equality instead of evidence of racial progress already made. This occurs because people tend to disengage from goals, including egalitarianism (
          Mann &amp; Kawakami, 2012), when they believe they have met them but not when they remain committed to them (
          Carver, 2003; 
          Fishbach, Dhar, &amp; Zhang, 2006). Thus, if people see exemplars of counterstereotypical success as evidence of the importance of egalitarian ideals rather than as evidence of what is already possible, this could help prevent them from drawing the conclusion that Blacks do not face a racial disadvantage. How to prompt people to spontaneously construe exemplars in this manner is an unresolved question.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Relatedly, we intentionally limited our sample to non-Black participants; thus, it remains unclear whether Blacks draw similar conclusions in response to counterstereotypically successful Black exemplars. 
          Eibach and Ehrlinger (2006) found that whereas White Americans assessed racial progress by looking at how much progress has already been made, Black Americans instead focused on how much progress still needed to be made. This suggests the automatic inferences identified here may not emerge in Black participants. That is, individual exemplars that show success is possible may shift Whites’ beliefs given their focus on any signs that progress has been made. Blacks’ focus on signs that progress still needs to be made may therefore lead them to be less likely to draw the same conclusions from single signs of progress.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The present research has focused on a very specific automatic inference, but there are likely to be other patterns of automatic inference, including other conclusions that people may draw in response to counterstereotypically successful exemplars. Perhaps in addition to inferring a friendlier climate, people also infer more positive attributes (e.g., being intelligent, hardworking) about the exemplars’ group. Consistent with this possibility, incidental exposure to Obama increased implicit positivity toward Blacks (
          Columb &amp; Plant, 2011; 
          Plant et al., 2009; cf. 
          Schmidt &amp; Nosek, 2010). Or, outside the racial context, perhaps people also show a reverse tendency to deny the influence of success-promoting factors when exposed to counterstereotypical failure (e.g., denying the usefulness of exercise after learning about a daily jogger who is diagnosed with diabetes). Just as a large literature has examined the sophistication as well as the shortcomings of people’s explicit logical reasoning (e.g., 
          Heit, 2000; 
          Johnson-Laird, 1999; 
          Mastropasqua et al., 2010), we hope, future research will more fully map out the forms that automatic inferences take.

We measured these beliefs toward each study’s end (instead of before the exemplar priming task) to avoid tipping off participants to the purpose of the study, but readers may wonder whether our manipulations contaminated these measures. We submitted the relevant item or composite to the same model used to test for automatic inferences. In four cases the same manipulation that prompted automatic inferences did not affect responses to these items: 
          <em>F</em> &lt; 1 (Study 1); 
          <em>F</em>(1, 163) = 2.15, 
          <em>p</em> &gt; .14 (Study 2);

          <em>F</em>(1, 183) = 6.50, 
          <em>p</em> = .01, but in the direction opposite to that of the automatic inference. Given that the explicit beliefs about the exemplars’ significance measure focus everyone—regardless of his or her exemplar priming condition—on the counterstereotypically successful exemplars, it should be no surprise that there were not parallel differences. Stated differently, we had no reason to suspect that recent incidental exposure to counterstereotypically successful exemplars (afforded by one version of the exemplar priming task) would change the way that people subsequently explicitly reason about them. It should be emphasized that these largely null effects do not establish that the explicit analyses of the exemplars’ significance are not what underlay the automatic inference effect. Instead, the tests we report later in the main text—those examining whether people lean on their explicit analyses of the Black primes more after seeing those primes versus not—are the crucial tests.

          <em>measures</em>. These studies often test whether a given manipulation influences an implicit measure (e.g., the Implicit Association Test) but not an explicit measure (e.g., a feeling thermometer). Although this form of dissociation emerges in our studies (see 
          <a id="b-fn1"> </a><sup>Footnote 1</sup>), it does not test whether the automatic inference process was guided by an explicit inference process. The automatic effect in our studies is captured by the between-condition differences on denial of racism following a Black or White prime (the output of which is measured with an explicit, self-report measure). The explicit inference process is captured by participants’ explicit beliefs about the Black exemplars’ significance. It is an estimate of how participants believe the automatic inference process does or should unfold. Because denial of racism scores and explicit judgments about the Black exemplars’ significance are both explicit measures that relate to participants’ beliefs about racism, it is not surprising that the two measures correlate. Our claim that automatic inferences unfold independently of these explicit beliefs is supported by showing that explicit beliefs do not guide the shift in denial of racism more following the Black (vs. White) primes.

Present exemplars were identified in the present tense (e.g., “is MSNBC news anchor”), whereas past exemplars were identified in the past tense or by use of a past-indicating adjective (e.g., “former basketball star”). Given that the exemplars in each category had a similar effect, this suggests that the present/past distinction did not influence the results. Also, an additional analysis in which we tested for the effect of present or past exemplars, regardless of category, showed no effect of this factor (

In neither case does it (
          <em>t</em>s &lt; 1). Nonetheless, Study 7 offers a more precise test of the possible moderating impact of the modern racism score, independent of motivation to avoid prejudice or need for cognition.

As expected, the community had a lower mean NFC (

          <em>t</em>(288) = 2.91, 
          <em>p</em> = .004. Extrapolating from Study 7’s results, had the mean NFC been that of the college student sample, the main effect of priming would have been right at the conventional boundary of significance,

That is, we were interested in how need for cognition affected one’s susceptibility to automatic inference-making, not differences in the overall denial-of-racism tendencies of individuals with high versus low need for cognition.</p><a id="fn9" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><sup>9</sup> Even though modern racism and the motivation to avoid prejudice did not moderate the automatic inferences people drew (nor, as follow-up tests showed, did the internal or external motivation to avoid prejudice subscales; 
          <em>t</em>s &lt; 1), we tested whether they were related to people’s explicit beliefs about the significance of the exemplars. Those higher on modern racism showed a stronger explicit belief that the exemplars supported there being less racism in America, 
          <em>r</em>(189) = .51,

          <em>r</em>(189) = .02, 
          <em>ns</em>. Given that modern racism did not moderate the automatic inference effect, the significant relationship between modern racism and explicit beliefs about the exemplars—analogous to a similar dissociation observed with political orientation in Studies 2 and 5—further reinforces the difference between automatic inference effects and explicit reasoning about the exemplars.

Some prominent African Americans have argued that continued problems within the Black community are largely to blame for the economically depressed nature of the Black community.
