We hypothesized that 1 reason for the prevalence of hierarchies is that they offer structure and therefore satisfy the core motivational needs for order and control relative to less structured forms of social organization. This hypothesis is rooted in compensatory control theory, which posits that (a) individuals have a basic need to perceive the world as orderly and structured, and (b) personal and external sources of control are capable of satisfying this need because both serve the comforting belief that the world operates in an orderly fashion. Our first 2 studies confirmed that hierarchies were perceived as more structured and orderly relative to egalitarian arrangements (Study 1) and that working in a hierarchical workplace promotes a feeling of self-efficacy (Study 2). We threatened participants’ sense of personal control and measured perceptions of and preferences for hierarchy in 5 subsequent experiments. Participants who lacked control perceived more hierarchy occurring in ambiguous social situations (Study 3) and preferred hierarchy more strongly in workplace contexts (Studies 4–5). We also provide evidence that hierarchies are indeed appealing because of their structure: Preference for hierarchy was higher among individuals high in Personal Need for Structure and a control threat increased preference for hierarchy even among participants low in Personal Need for Structure (Study 5). Framing a hierarchy as unstructured reversed the effect of control threat on hierarchy (Study 6). Finally, hierarchy-enhancing jobs were more appealing after control threat, even when they were low in power and status (Study 7).

For example, the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, resulted in a surge of support for hierarchy-promoting social structures such as police and the military (
        Jones, 2003). In a classic study, 
        Sales (1972) found that in times of economic uncertainty, people turn to more hierarchical churches. 
        Lane (1959, p. 35) went so far as to argue that “many members of the working classes do not want equality” because it deprives them of order and meaning provided by the older, more hierarchical social order. It seems that the drive toward egalitarianism is often thwarted by basic and countervailing psychological needs.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We propose that hierarchical social structures offer psychological benefits and that these benefits are one reason why hierarchies are so prevalent. In particular, we argue that core motivational needs for order make hierarchies psychologically appealing—because of the structure they offer—relative to less structured forms of social organization. Drawing on compensatory control theory (
        Kay, Gaucher, Napier, Callan, &amp; Laurin, 2008; 
        Kay, Whitson, Gaucher, &amp; Galinsky, 2009; 
        Whitson &amp; Galinsky, 2008), we threatened participants’ sense of personal control to increase their need for sources of structure and assessed whether this lack of control increased preferences for hierarchy as a method of social organization.

        Eagly &amp; Karau, 1991; 
        Halevy, Chou, &amp; Galinsky, 2011; 
        Sadler &amp; Woody, 2003; 
        Sidanius &amp; Pratto, 1999). Because of their prevalence, it has been a preoccupation of social science to explain the human propensity to form hierarchies (
        Dumont, 1980; 
        Sidanius &amp; Pratto, 1999; 
        Weber, 1947/1964). Even in the United States, the “American paradox” (
        Myrdal, 1944/1996) is that much of American society is strongly hierarchical in practice (
        Jäntti et al., 2006), despite strong cultural ideals that emphasize equality (
        Deutsch, 2006; 
        Kluegel &amp; Smith, 1986; 
        Norton &amp; Ariely, 2011) and some attempts at creating flat organizations (e.g., 
        Shaer, 2013; 
        Silverman, 2012; 
        Worthy, 1950).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">As a general definition, a hierarchy is a tiered arrangement of objects, with some entities being higher or lower than other entities on a particular dimension. A social hierarchy is a vertically stratified relationship between two or more people or groups in which those at higher levels of the hierarchy have greater power and status than those at lower levels of the hierarchy (see 
        Magee &amp; Galinsky, 2008). Those at higher levels of a hierarchy typically have greater decision-making authority, privileged access to material and symbolic resources, more rights and freedoms, and greater ability to make and enforce rules than those at lower levels of the hierarchy.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Although the inequality intrinsic to hierarchies is often criticized, functional models of hierarchy (e.g., 
        Halevy, Chou, &amp; Galinsky, 2011; 
        Magee &amp; Galinsky, 2008) propose that hierarchies are so common, in part, because they facilitate group performance. They do this through incentives that promote effort (
        Abramitzky, 2011) and increased coordination and cooperation among group members (
        Halevy et al., 2011; 
        Halevy, Chou, Galinsky, &amp; Murnighan, 2012). In small groups, hierarchical differentiation among the group members improves task performance, especially on tasks that involve interdependence (
        Ronay, Greenaway, Anicich, &amp; Galinsky, 2012). Even at a basic cognitive level, individuals process hierarchically organized social stimuli more quickly and easily than stimuli not organized hierarchically (
        Zitek &amp; Tiedens, 2012). Furthermore, task-oriented individuals are more likely to perceive hierarchy in their social relationships (
        Tiedens, Unzueta, &amp; Young, 2007). These functional accounts nicely demonstrate how the structure often present within hierarchies enhances performance on the part of individuals or the group as a whole (e.g., by promoting coordination and role differentiation). In the present set of studies, we build on this work by empirically assessing the possible psychological benefits for individuals that might be derived from the structure and order associated with social hierarchy.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Evidence suggests that hierarchies have become imbued with potent psychological significance as both those higher and lower in the hierarchy support its existence. Being at the top of a hierarchy satisfies a cluster of psychological needs related to power, status, dominance, and self-esteem (
        Fiske, 2011; 
        Leary, Cottrell, &amp; Phillips, 2001; 
        Magee &amp; Galinsky, 2008; 
        Sidanius &amp; Pratto, 1999). Although higher ranked individuals accrue the most obvious benefits from hierarchies (e.g., power, status, resources), lower ranked individuals often demonstrate significant support for hierarchies (
        Anderson, Willer, Kilduff, &amp; Brown, 2012; 
        Jost, Pelham, &amp; Carvallo, 2002; 
        Jost, Pelham, Sheldon, &amp; Sullivan, 2003; 
        Levin, Frederico, Sidanius, &amp; Rabinowitz, 2002; 
        Rankin, Jost, &amp; Wakslak, 2009; 
        Sidanius, Levin, &amp; Pratto, 1996; but see 
        Brandt, 2013), especially when those hierarchies represent the status quo (
        Jost &amp; Banaji, 1994; 
        Kay, Gaucher, et al., 2009; 
        Wakslak, Jost, &amp; Bauer, 2011). For example, even disadvantaged individuals who live in socially stratified systems will bolster and defend a variety of hierarchies, including stratification systems based on gender (
        Glick &amp; Fiske, 2001; 
        Jost &amp; Kay, 2005; 
        Kay, Gaucher, et al., 2009; 
        Laurin, Shepherd, &amp; Kay, 2010; 
        Rudman, Moss-Racusin, Phelan, &amp; Nauts, 2012), race (
        Jost, Pelham, &amp; Carvallo, 2002), and economic circumstance (
        Kay, Czapliński, &amp; Jost, 2009; 
        Kay &amp; Jost, 2003; 
        Malahy, Rubinlicht, &amp; Kaiser, 2009).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In sum, it is clear that hierarchies have functional benefits and can serve psychological needs for power, status, and status quo maintenance. In addition, however, we propose that hierarchies are specifically conducive to fulfilling the psychological need to perceive one’s existence and surroundings as structured. By structured, we mean clear, orderly, and predict able and not ambiguous or random (
        Kay, Laurin, Fitzsimons, &amp; Landau, 2013). That is, the structured nature of hierarchies—the clarity and order they provide—may give them a type of psychological advantage over more equal forms of social organization, especially in circumstances when people lack personal control and needs for external structure are therefore particularly salient.
      </p><a id="psp-106-4-590-ELDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_14" title="Compensatory Control">Compensatory Control</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The notion that one’s life circumstances might be uncontrolled often provokes anxiety (e.g., 
        Glass, Singer, &amp; Friedman, 1969; 
        Laurin, Kay, &amp; Moscovitch, 2008). As such, people are often motivated to believe they have personal control over their lives (e.g., 
        Averill, 1973; 
        Burger &amp; Cooper, 1979; 
        Rothbaum, Weisz, &amp; Snyder, 1982; 
        Seligman, 1975). Compensatory control theory proposes that personal control is valued, in part, because it is a subgoal of a larger motivation to see the world as structured, orderly, and nonrandom (
        Kay et al., 2008; 
        Kay, Whitson, et al., 2009). Having personal control is associated with many positive outcomes (
        Langer &amp; Rodin, 1976; 
        Taylor &amp; Brown, 1988; 
        Taylor, Lichtman, &amp; Wood, 1984) and, as such, is often the default preference in Western cultures (
        Markus &amp; Kitayama, 2003) for affirming that the world is not random. Personal control can be achieved by being able to choose one’s preferred outcomes (
        Averill, 1973) or by exercising power over others (
        Inesi, Botti, Dubois, Rucker, &amp; Galinsky, 2011).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">But when uncontrolled events occur and are observed, positive or negative, they can threaten perceptions of personal control and, by extension, of the world’s structure. These might be larger events such as natural disasters (
        Eccleston, Kaiser, &amp; Kraynak, 2010; 
        Kaiser, Eccleston, &amp; Hagiwara, 2008; 
        Napier, Mandisodza, Andersen, &amp; Jost, 2006) or smaller, everyday events such as undeserved but mundane fortune (
        Gaucher, Hafer, Kay, &amp; Davidenko, 2010; 
        Kay et al., 2008). Such events can shake an individual’s confidence in his or her personal control over outcomes to a greater or lesser degree. There are also individual differences in the extent to which people chronically feel in control of their lives (
        Burger &amp; Cooper, 1979; 
        Paulhus &amp; Van Selst, 1990).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Compensatory control theory proposes that people maintain perceptions of the world as orderly and structured by complementing beliefs in personal control with external sources of structure in the physical and social world (
        Kay et al., 2008; 
        Kay, Shepherd, Blatz, Chua, &amp; Galinsky, 2010; 
        Whitson &amp; Galinsky, 2008). External sources of structure might be explicitly controlling (e.g., belief that God is in control; 
        Kay et al., 2008; 
        Sasaki &amp; Kim, 2011) or any belief that provides order and predictability to one’s social environment (
        Hui &amp; Zhou, 1996), such as superstitions and conspiracy theories (
        Whitson &amp; Galinsky, 2008) or even consumer products (
        Shepherd, Kay, Landau, &amp; Keefer, 2011). For example, believing that God has a plan for one’s life provides a sense of predictability and order, even if one cannot choose the specifics of that plan.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Overall, compensatory control theory suggests that personal and external sources of control jointly contribute to perceptions of a structured, rather than random or chaotic, social world. Because of this, the theory also suggests that if one source of structure (e.g., personal control) is lowered or threatened, people will compensate by increasingly relying on the other (e.g., external control). Furthermore, because perceptions of structure and order are generally considered the building blocks of long-term goal pursuit (
        Lerner, 1980), compensatory control theory further suggests that external structure crucial for promoting individual goal-directed action (
        Kay, Landau, &amp; Sullivan, in press; 
        Kay et al., 2013).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">A burgeoning research literature has identified numerous examples of how people who lack personal control—and thus experience anxiety that the world is unstructured—compensate by affirming structure in other sources. People who lack personal control perceive increased structure in random arrays (i.e., see pictures in static; 
        Whitson &amp; Galinsky, 2008) and believe more strongly in agents that impose structure on the world, such as a controlling god or a controlling government (
        Kay et al., 2008; 
        Kay, Moscovitch, &amp; Laurin, 2010; 
        Kay, Shepherd, et al., 2010; 
        Shepherd et al., 2011). People lacking personal control also endorse scientific theories that suggest orderliness rather than randomness (
        Rutjens, van der Pligt, &amp; van Harreveld, 2010; 
        Rutjens, van Harreveld, &amp; van der Pligt, 2010; 
        Rutjens, van Harreveld, van der Pligt, Kreemers, &amp; Noordewier, 2013), and folk beliefs that provide orderly explanations for negative events can foster a more global sense of control (
        Chipperfield et al., 2012). Individuals lacking personal control are also more likely to prefer consumer products that restore structure (
        Shepherd et al., 2011) or logos and brands that have clear, well-defined boundaries (
        Cutright, 2012).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">According to compensatory control theory, people will at times engage in phenomena of compensatory control even when the compensatory outlet offers little or no material benefit to the individual. In fact, under control threat, people may prefer sources of structure that are seemingly negative to more positive but less structured options. For example, in one study (
        Rutjens et al., 2013), significantly more individuals preferred a structured disease course over an unstructured disease course, even though the former had a more negative prognosis, when their sense of control was threatened (vs. unthreatened). When personal control is undermined, people also compensate by increasingly endorsing the existence of relatively nefarious sources of order, including powerful enemies (
        Sullivan, Landau, &amp; Rothschild, 2010) and elaborate conspiracies (
        Whitson &amp; Galinsky, 2008). It seems that when people are motivated to find ways to preserve their belief in an orderly and structured world, even negative order is sometimes preferred to no order at all.
      </p><a id="psp-106-4-590-EKDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_22" title="Compensatory Control and the Endorsement of Hierarchy">Compensatory Control and the Endorsement of Hierarchy</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">It is clear from these findings that when personal control is undermined people compensate by imposing structure on their external contexts. We argue that hierarchies—because they provide structure—are a particularly important route to restore feelings of control. This hypothesis would offer a novel explanation for the persistence of hierarchies that complements existing functional accounts. Our hypothesis also bridges and enriches other prevailing social psychology theories on hierarchies, such as social dominance (
        Sidanius &amp; Pratto, 1999) and system justification (
        Jost &amp; Banaji, 1994), a point we expand upon in the Discussion section.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">A critical first question to answer is whether hierarchies are actually perceived as more structured than more equal arrangements. There is some evidence that social groups, whether large organizations or intimate friendships, can be simultaneously egalitarian and structured (
        Krackhardt &amp; Kilduff, 1999; 
        Rothschild-Whitt, 1979)and that hierarchies can be unstructured (
        Abrahamson, 2002; 
        Jordan, Sivanathan, &amp; Galinsky, 2011; 
        Maner &amp; Mead, 2010). However, we propose that hierarchies will be more psychologically conducive to providing structure than will egalitarian arrangements. Compared to equality, hierarchies more explicitly provide rules about who should be doing what and describe a predictable pattern of relations among group members. For example, a hierarchically organized workplace typically has managers and employees with well-defined roles; in fact, role differentiation and hierarchical differentiation tend to co-vary in organizations (
        Baron &amp; Pfeffer, 1994; 
        Chonko, 1982; 
        Gruenfeld &amp; Tiedens, 2010). Someone whose sense of personal control has been threatened might find hierarchy appealing as a means of reestablishing a more general sense of structure. Indeed, past theoretical work has proposed the possibility that hierarchies fulfill the psychological need for structure (
        Magee &amp; Galinsky, 2008), and correlational evidence suggests that needs for structure and hierarchy-enhancing ideology are related (
        Jost, Glaser, Kruglanski, &amp; Sulloway, 2003; 
        Van Hiel, Pandelaere, &amp; Duriez, 2004).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The current work tests our hypothesis that hierarchies are so prevalent in part because they provide order and structure and thereby serve as a means of compensatory control. Although previous research has investigated the benefits of hierarchy for groups or organizations (e.g., 
        Ronay et al., 2012), or the psychological benefits that accrue to dominant individuals (e.g., 
        Magee &amp; Galinsky, 2008; 
        Sidanius &amp; Pratto, 1999), relatively less work has examined intrapsychic processes that lead to support for hierarchies among even disadvantaged individuals and groups (but see 
        Jost &amp; Major, 2001) and no work has examined this from the perspective of compensatory control. Here, we propose that an intrapsychic process supports the prevalence of hierarchies by demonstrating that hierarchy, by virtue of its ability to serve core psychological needs for structure, will have a psychological advantage over equality, especially when people experience personal control threat.

Our first study tested whether hierarchy is perceived as more structured than more equal arrangements. We next examined whether being in a hierarchy can engender a sense of control in individuals by assessing the level of hierarchy present in participants’ own workplaces and measuring their sense of workplace certainty and self-efficacy.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">After establishing these links between hierarchy and a sense of structure, self-efficacy, and certainty, we explored whether hierarchy can serve as a means of compensatory control by manipulating levels of personal control and assessing the extent to which people were drawn to hierarchy. We tested whether threats to control lead people to perceive hierarchy in an ambiguous social interaction (Study 3), prefer more hierarchy in their workplaces (Studies 4–5), and find hierarchy-enhancing careers more appealing, even when those careers are low in power and status (Study 7).</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We also tested the relationship between need for structure and preferences for hierarchy through correlational and experimental evidence: Correlationally, we assessed whether individuals high in Personal Need for Structure (PNS) would prefer hierarchies more than those low in PNS (Study 5). Experimentally, we manipulated whether hierarchy was framed as structured or unstructured and observed whether this moderated hierarchy’s appeal following a loss of control. In doing so, we tested the hypothesis that framing hierarchy as unstructured but advantageous in other ways would reverse the previous effects, so that participants who lacked personal control would now find hierarchy unappealing (Study 6).</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Overall, the current theory and experiments bridge two separate literatures—the social structural literature on hierarchy with the intrapsychic literature on personal control—to offer new insights into why hierarchies are the dominant form of social organization. In doing so, we also provide key support for compensatory control theory and broaden existing theories of why people support hierarchy (social dominance and system justification theories).</p><a id="psp-106-4-590-EIDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_33" title="Study 1: Hierarchy Offers More Structure">Study 1: Hierarchy Offers More Structure</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We have proposed that hierarchical social arrangements are perceived as offering more structure. However, it is possible that structure is perceived to occur in groups organized either hierarchically or equally. Indeed, previous theory has speculated that hierarchical social arrangements are structured but probably not more so than egalitarian groups (
        Magee &amp; Galinsky, 2008). In contrast, we propose that, regardless of whether these different social arrangements differ in their actual degree of structure, hierarchical social groups are perceived as significantly more structured than more egalitarian social groups. Study 1, therefore, tested whether hierarchies are indeed perceived as more structured by gauging people’s perceptions of how hierarchy and equality relate to structure, order, and other relevant concepts.

          <em>t</em> tests. As shown in 
          Figures 1 and 
          2, there were dramatic differences in how hierarchical and egalitarian social groups were perceived. The words that were rated are shown in 
          Figure 1. Supporting our hypotheses, hierarchy was rated as more structured, predictable, stable, well controlled, well coordinated, resistant to change, and efficient (all 
          <em>p</em>s &lt; .05). In contrast, equality was rated more chaotic and unpredictable but also as more fair and natural (all 
          <em>p</em>s &lt; .05). Neither concept was rated as more dependable or safe (all 
          <em>p</em>s &gt; .15).
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The phrases that were rated are shown in 
          Figure 2. Hierarchies were associated more strongly with role differentiation and the status quo (e.g., conveying who should listen to whom; all 
          <em>p</em>s &lt; .001) but not with participants’ ideals about how groups should be organized, which was marginally more associated with equality (
          <em>p</em> = .08). When hierarchy and equality were assessed together on a bipolar scale, results were generally the same as when they were assessed independently, except that on the bipolar scale neither concept was rated as more natural and hierarchy was rated as more dependable.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In sum, hierarchy was seen as more structured, orderly, and predictable than equality. Study 1 also found some of the perceived functional benefits of hierarchies identified in previous research (e.g., efficiency; 
          Halevy et al., 2011). It is also noteworthy—and consistent with the “American paradox” (
          Myrdal, 1944/1996)—that equality was seen as more fair and more strongly the way people should be organized. These results establish the general premise of our hypothesis that hierarchy can serve as a source of social structure and, potentially, as a means of compensatory control.

This is a key foundation finding for our larger hypothesis that hierarchy can serve as a means of compensatory control; that is, for people whose sense of personal control is low and are thus motivated to impose structure on their social contexts. Additionally, according to compensatory control theory, perceiving structure is not only psychologically advantageous in itself, as a means of perceiving the world as orderly and nonrandom, but is also a means of reestablishing the confidence necessary to engage in goal-directed action after personal control has been threatened (
        Kay et al., 2013; 
        Kay et al., in press; 
        Laurin, Fitzsimons, &amp; Kay, 2011). To the extent that hierarchy can serve as an outlet of compensatory control, then, engagement in a social hierarchy should both increase certainty about one’s actions and facilitate perceived efficacy. We tested this by assessing the relation between employed participants’ perceptions of hierarchy in their workplaces and (a) their occupational self-efficacy (i.e., beliefs that one is able to be effective at and achieve goals within one’s job) and (b) their workplace certainty (i.e., confidence about where one’s career is heading and one’s position in the organization). We expected that workplace hierarchy would be associated with increased self-efficacy and increased workplace certainty.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We also hypothesized a boundary condition to the effects of hierarchy on certainty and self-efficacy. Given that hierarchies—for example, in the workplace—are not universally structured (e.g., 
        Jordan et al., 2011), we reasoned that hierarchies that are unstructured or unpredictable in some way might not be as effective at promoting employee self-efficacy or certainty. In this study we operationalized structured as whether participants’ workplaces are considered procedurally just, which is the extent to which their workplaces’ procedures and practices are perceived of as consistent, objective, and applied without bias (
        Colquitt, 2001; 
        Lind &amp; Tyler, 1988). A hierarchy that is not procedurally just is likely to be experienced as unstructured, because the absence of procedural constraints and rules allow high-ranking members of the organization to make arbitrary and unpredictable decisions (
        Lind &amp; van den Bos, 2002). This reasoning is consistent with research showing that disadvantaged groups are especially sensitive to the justice and fairness (i.e., predictability) of their occupational contexts and are less willing to pursue long-term goals when perceived societal unfairness is high (
        Laurin et al., 2011). We therefore predicted that workplace hierarchy would not increase self-efficacy and certainty when procedural justice was low.

            <em>SD</em> = .72; α = .81). The measure was based on 
            Colquitt, 2001; e.g., “To what extent are procedures in your workplace applied consistently?”), and items were answered on a 5-point scale (1 = 
            <em>Never,</em> 5 = 
            <em>All of the time</em>). Participants also completed a two-item measure of workplace status: “Think about your current job and your place in the workplace ladder. Where would you place yourself … in your workplace as a whole?” (
            <em>M</em> = 37.8, 
            <em>SD</em> = 25.5) and “… in your current department or workgroup?” (
            <em>M</em> = 55.0, 
            <em>SD</em> = 27.7). These were answered in on a 0–100 sliding scale (0 = lowest rank, 100 = highest rank). The two items were highly correlated, 
            <em>r</em>(142) = .66, 
            <em>p</em> &lt; .001, so their mean was used as the measure of workplace status (
            <em>M</em> = 46.4, 
            <em>SD</em> = 24.3).
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Next, participants completed the measure of hierarchy present in their own workplace. Because of the correlational design of this study, we chose to first include an especially subtle measure of workplace hierarchy to avoid any potential for demand characteristics. Specifically, participants were asked to rate the similarity of six hierarchically themed images (and four filler images) to their own workplace on a 5-point scale (1 = 
            <em>Not at all like my workplace,</em> 5 = 
            <em>Just like my workplace</em>). The hierarchical images were a group of chess pieces, ladder, mountain, pyramid, vertically oriented set of stick figures, and “food ladder” of animals (
            <em>M</em> = 2.32, 
            <em>SD</em> = .52; α = .42).
            <a id="b-fn3"> </a><sup /> Therefore, people reporting more similarity between their own workplace and the hierarchical images presumably work in a more hierarchical environment. The filler images were traffic, a frog, a sunset, and an empty desk. Image presentation order was random within each participant.
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Participants also completed one item that explicitly measured their perceived workplace hierarchy: “Some workplaces are organized more ‘vertically’ and some are organized in ‘flatter’ ways. How is your workplace organized?” on a 7-point scale (1 = 
            <em>My workplace is flat with no levels,</em> 7 = 
            <em>My workplace has many levels</em>; 
            <em>M</em> = 4.48, 
            <em>SD</em> = 1.86). The image and explicit measures were correlated, 
            <em>r</em>(142) = .32, 
            <em>p</em> = .01and were more reliable when combined (α = .49) than when used alone, so we standardized both measures and used their mean as our independent variable. (In the survey itself, the explicit hierarchy item came after the dependent variables.)
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Next, participants completed an occupational self-efficacy scale (
            <em>M</em> = 5.61,

            Schyns &amp; von Collani, 2002, 8-item short form). The items (e.g., “If I am in trouble at my work, I can usually think of something to do”) were rated on a 7-point scale (1 = 
            <em>Strongly disagree</em> to 7 = 
            <em>Strongly agree</em>). Following that was an eight-item measure of occupational certainty (e.g., “To what extent are you certain … about the direction in which your career is heading?”; 
            <em>M</em> = 3.29, 
            <em>SD</em> = .84; α = .85) based on 
            Bordia, Hobman, Jones, Gallois, and Callan (2004) and rated on a 7-point scale (1 = 
            <em>Very uncertain,</em> 7 =

            Whitson &amp; Galinsky, 2008). Participants were randomly assigned to conditions in this and all subsequent studies. Participants in the control threat condition (
            <em>n</em> = 49) recalled and wrote about a time where they lacked control: “Please recall a particular incident in which something happened and you did not have any control over the situation. Please describe the situation in which you felt a complete lack of control—what happened, how you felt, etc., in up to 100 words.” Participants in the control unthreatened condition (
            <em>n</em> = 51) wrote about a time when they had control. In past compensatory control research, participants who wrote about a time when they had control did not differ from participants who were assigned a neutral writing task where they wrote about a topic unrelated to control (
            Cutright, 2012).
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Participants next read one of two passages describing a social interaction among a small group of people in which the extent of the hierarchy was ambiguous. For example, individuals in the groups were presented as peers, suggestive of equality, but in each scenario one or two characters tended to take the lead in planning, which is suggestive of dominance, and other characters deferred to those plans, which is suggestive of submissiveness (
            Sadler &amp; Woody, 2003). We used two different passages to ensure that any effects occurring were not due to some unique feature of a particular scenario. The instructions read: “Here we are interested in how people perceive individuals in interactions with others. Below you will see a short story. Please read it carefully because afterward we will test your memory and ask you some questions about what occurred.” Half of participants (
            <em>n</em>threatened = 23, 
            <em>n</em>unthreatened = 25) read the following group project scenario:

            
<blockquote>Rebecca, Jacob, and Alex met in the library to work on their group project—a presentation for their psychology class. The three of them had seen each other in class, but this was the first time they’d spoken outside of class. Alex made a suggestion based on last week’s lecture but Jacob didn’t think it was a good idea. Alex insisted on it and the two argued for a few minutes. Finally, Rebecca put forth an alternative, which Jacob loved. Alex agreed too, reluctantly. Alex didn’t like Rebecca’s idea but went along anyway just to be done with it. Rebecca said, “Let’s do some Internet research together right now, then write down a few ideas.” Alex really wanted to divide up the work and do it on his own, instead of as a group, but didn’t say anything.</blockquote></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The remaining participants (
            <em>n</em>threatened = 26, 
            <em>n</em>unthreatened = 26) read a vacation planning scenario where two working-age couples discussed their annual vacation while playing cards.
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The dependent measure was the amount of hierarchy that was perceived to have occurred during the interaction. This was measured by having participants how much each character contributed to, controlled, influenced, and dominated the situation on a 5-point scale (1 = 
            <em>Nothing at all</em> to 5 = 
            <em>Completely</em>). The reliability of the ratings of each character ranged from α = .68 to .85 (
            <em>M</em>α = .80 for the six characters).
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We operationalized the amount of hierarchy occurring as the mean variance in the ratings (see 
            Halevy et al., 2012). That is, if the interaction was perceived as highly hierarchical, presumably one or two of the actors would be perceived as highly dominant (controlling, etc.) and the remaining actors would have been seen as less dominant. If so, there would be high variance in the dominance ratings between the actors. In contrast, if the scenario was seen as more egalitarian, no actor should have been rated as more dominant than the others. Here there should have been low variance in the dominance ratings between the actors. Therefore, as our measure of the amount of hierarchy occurring in each scenario, we calculated the variance in the characters’ ratings on each of the four dimensions individually, and the mean of those four variances was used as the dependent measure (
            <em>M</em> = 2.46, 
            <em>SD</em> = 1.26, range = 0 to 4.75).

          <em>F</em>(1, 96) = 4.11, 
          <em>p</em> = .04, η
          p<sup>2</sup> = .04, so that there was more variance in ratings (i.e., participants perceived more hierarchy in the interaction) when control was threatened (
          <em>M</em> = 2.70, 
          <em>SD</em> = 1.23) than when it was unthreatened (
          <em>M</em> = 2.23, 
          <em>SD</em> = 1.25). There was also a difference between scenarios so that participants also reported more variance in ratings for the vacation planning scenario (
          <em>M</em> = 3.13, 
          <em>SD</em> = 0.96) than the group project scenario (
          <em>M</em> = 1.72,

Our control threat articles described (a) the economy as uncontrolled or (b) the world more generally as random. Our baseline article was unrelated to control.

We expected that both types of threat would increase preference for hierarchy relative to the neutral condition.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We included two control threat articles to test the influence of both domain-specific control threats (i.e., the economy is uncontrolled) and more general control threats (i.e., the world is uncontrolled) on preference for hierarchy.

        Banfield, Nadolny, &amp; Kay, 2013; 
        Whitson &amp; Galinsky, 2008) and is the mundane type of control-threatening information people encounter regularly when they learn about current events (e.g.,

It could be argued that in Study 3, writing about having control was actually an affirmation and that affirmation reduced preference for hierarchy rather than threat increasing preference for hierarchy. Although this hypothesis would not be consistent with past research that has found that lacking control increases compensatory control processes relative to both participants who write about having control and participants who write about a neutral topic unrelated to control (
        Cutright, 2012), including a neutral comparison group here will more clearly establish the direction of any effects.

Cornwallis made the comments at a conference hosted by Harvard University in January. The conference, titled “Understanding the World,” was aimed at trying to understand the causes of events in the world. Cornwallis was one of several panelists who agreed that the world mostly operates in erratic, unpredictable ways.At the same conference, Marten Keese, a professor at Utrecht University in the Netherlands, spoke about an article he published in the renowned journal 
                <i>Science.</i> Keese claimed that people’s behaviour does not have clear causes. Although people may believe that the world is orderly and nonrandom, Keese says our perceptions are flawed. “Unperceived factors determine what happens to us. Most people believe their outcomes are under control, but our data suggest that random fluctuations have greater effects.”

On the contrary, O’Connell found evidence that farmers in both developed and underdeveloped countries produce enough to live existences considered “comfortable” by the standards of their countries. The report included data from 1990–2011, and the trends indicate that farming continues to be a sensible career choice.</blockquote></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The dependent variable was a 6-item measure of preference for hierarchy in the workplace (α = .59).

The items were loosely based on the Social Dominance Orientation scale (

Using multiple regression, we regressed preference for hierarchy on mean-centered workplace status, coded predictors representing the same planned contrasts for the condition effects (Contrast 1: economic threat = 1, general threat = 1, neutral = −2; Contrast 2: economic threat = −1, general threat = 1, neutral = 0), and their interaction terms.

Thus, not only do people perceive more hierarchy following control threat (Study 3), but they also prefer it. We conceptually replicated Study 4’s effect of personal control threat on preference for workplace hierarchy in a separate sample of participants (
          <em>N</em> = 84) using the manipulation of personal control from Study 3 (
          Whitson &amp; Galinsky, 2008) and the same measure of hierarchy preference used in Study 4 (α = .64). Participants recalled and wrote about a time when they lacked personal control or a time when they had personal control. Threatened participants showed more preference for workplace hierarchy (

        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Studies 3 and 4 demonstrate our basic hypothesized effect: lacking control increases preferences for hierarchical arrangements. However, these studies have not specifically addressed our proposed mechanism: that hierarchy becomes appealing after control threat, at least in part, because of the structure it offers. Studies 5 and 6 directly examined the connection between personal control and the structure that hierarchy provides.</p><a id="psp-106-4-590-EEDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_107" title="Study 5: The Need for Structure and the Need for Hierarchy">Study 5: The Need for Structure and the Need for Hierarchy</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Study 5 assessed the effects of both a personal control threat manipulation and a chronic individual difference measure directly related to the need for structure—Personal Need for Structure (PNS; 
        Neuberg &amp; Newsom, 1993; see also 
        Webster &amp; Kruglanski, 1994)—on preferences for hierarchy. If hierarchy is preferred in part because of the structure it confers on the social world, then people who chronically seek out structure—those high in PNS—should prefer hierarchy more strongly than people less predisposed to prefer structure.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We also tested whether this chronic individual difference would interact with control threat. Past research has demonstrated that motivational threats elicit a particular motivation most strongly among individuals whose chronic levels of that particular motivation are lower. In effect, threat makes the motivation salient for everyone. Commonly, following threat, the responses of those low on a particular chronic motivation begin to more closely resemble those high in that motive (
        Banfield, Kay, Cutright, Wu, &amp; Fitzsimons, 2011; 
        Nail &amp; McGregor, 2009; 
        Nail, McGregor, Drinkwater, Steele, &amp; Thompson, 2009; but see 
        Landau, Greenberg, Solomon, Pyszczynski, &amp; Martens, 2006). Thus, to the extent that (a) hierarchy is attractive because it offers structure and (b) control threat leads to preferences for hierarchy because it increases the need for structure, we expected that in baseline conditions people high in PNS would demonstrate a greater preference for hierarchy than those low in PNS, but under control threat conditions, low-PNS individuals would also show a preference for hierarchy, a preference that would closely match their high-PNS counterparts.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Study 5 also addressed a possible alternative explanation from Study 3: response valence. In Study 3, participants were asked to recall and write about a time when they lacked control (or had control), and they were free to write about both positive and negative events. The advantage of this manipulation is that participants are free to recall a wider range of events that are likely representative of the types of control-threatening events that people encounter in their daily lives. It is possible, however, that negative affect might co-vary with the experimental condition if participants in the threat condition recalled more negative events than participants in the nonthreat condition. Even so, negative affect alone is not sufficient to produce compensatory control processes (
        Whitson &amp; Galinsky, 2008) and according to compensatory control theory, any loss of personal control—even resulting from positive events like undeserved fortune—can increase needs for structure and strivings for compensatory control (
        Gaucher et al., 2010; 
        Kay et al., 2008). To rule out valence-based explanations in the current context of hierarchy preference, Study 5 used a manipulation of personal control that kept response valence constant across the two recall conditions by instructing participants in both conditions to recall a positive event. Together with Study 4, where an article manipulation was used, the use of these different personal control manipulations allowed us to more definitively ensure that the effects of control threat on hierarchy preference were not limited to just one operationalization of threat.

Sample uncontrolled events that were listed included an unexpected bonus at work, a lottery windfall, and surprise concert tickets from a friend; sample controlled events included a work promotion, a profitable stock investment, and an extra night out with friends. In past research this manipulation affected feelings of perceived personal control but not mood or self-esteem (

The main effect of threat conceptually replicates Study 4, where participants whose sense of control was threatened preferred hierarchy more than participants who were unthreatened. The main effect of PNS is consistent with our hypothesis that hierarchies can be a source of structure, because they were preferred more by people who chronically prefer structure. The interaction of control threat with PNS is consistent with our proposal that lacking control leads to preferences for hierarchy because of the connection between hierarchy and structure.</p><a id="psp-106-4-590-EDDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_122" title="Study 6: When Hierarchy Is Unstructured">Study 6: When Hierarchy Is Unstructured</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Although hierarchies are often perceived as more structured than equality (Study 1), they are not necessarily always so (
        Abrahamson, 2002). Within a business hierarchy, for example, regular promotions, demotions, and reorganizations might introduce elements of instability (
        Jordan et al., 2011; 
        Maner &amp; Mead, 2010), or a workplace might be unjust and arbitrary (
        Colquitt, 2001), as shown in Study 2. Conditions of instability or injustice put the structure of a hierarchy into question.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">For people lacking personal control and thus looking to reestablish structure in their social circumstances, an unstructured hierarchy should not be appealing. Indeed, it might be particularly unappealing. A finding that control threat decreases the attractiveness of hierarchies framed as disorderly would provide an important boundary condition as well as evidence for our proposed mechanism that lacking control increases a preference for hierarchies because it provides a sense of structure. That is, this finding would demonstrate that hierarchies are only able to serve as a means of compensatory control when they are perceived as structured. It would also be consistent with the findings of Study 2, where engagement with a hierarchy did not promote feelings of control and certainty when procedural justice was low.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We tested these predictions in a workplace context by threatening or not threatening participants’ personal control and also manipulating whether workplace hierarchies were perceived as unstructured or not. We manipulated hierarchy’s perceived structure by having half of participants read a passage stating that hierarchical workplaces are often unstructured because people compete for power and status, which creates disorder and role confusion. To ensure that the unstructured passage was not entirely negative, we included positive information, stating that lacking structure also allows flexibility in responding to new challenges. The remaining participants did not read the unstructured framing passage. We then assessed participants’ preference for hierarchy in a workplace context.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">This produced a 2 (control threatened vs. unthreatened) by 2 (hierarchy unstructured vs. no framing) between-participants design. In the no framing condition, where the structure of hierarchy was not manipulated, we predicted that participants would hold the default view of hierarchy as being structured (Study 1) and, as such, threatened participants would prefer hierarchy more than would unthreatened participants (a direct replication of Study 5). When we explicitly framed hierarchy as unstructured, however, we expected the opposite pattern such that threatened participants, whose needs for structure are salient, would prefer (unstructured) hierarchy less than unthreatened participants.</p><a id="psp-106-4-590-EBDDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We recruited 155 participants.

            <em>n</em>unthreatened = 36) the following framing manipulation was included to challenge the belief that hierarchies are structured. To ensure that the passage was not wholly negative, it also mentioned several positive consequences of lacking structure (i.e., flexibility, adaptability).

            
<blockquote>As you consider your preferences, keep in mind that although hierarchical groups might appear orderly on the surface, it’s possible for them to be quite unstructured in practice. In a hierarchical company, employees often jostle for power which prevents employees from knowing their roles in fulfilling the company’s overall goals. In these cases the guidelines for each person’s duties are often unclear. However, conflict can motivate employees to put in more effort and can create a flexibility that allows the company to more easily adapt to new conditions.</blockquote>
The remaining participants (

            <em>Not at all,</em> 7 =

This scale focused on participants’ willingness to invest in and be part of a hierarchical organization: “If you were going to invest some money, would you rather invest in …”; “If you were going to work at a company and start at the bottom, would you rather work at …”; “If you were going to be in management at a company, would you rather work at …”; “Which type of company seems more profitable?”; and “Which type of company seems like a better place to work at?” Participants responded to each item on a 7-point scale (1 =

Although hierarchies are commonly perceived as being structured and thus are appealing after control threat, when hierarchies are perceived to be unstructured they no longer have a compelling allure for control threatened individuals. These findings also support our contention that hierarchy’s structure is what makes it appealing as a means of compensatory control; when the implications of hierarchy for structure are taken away—despite possessing other positive qualities like flexibility—hierarchies lose their compensatory appeal.</p><a id="psp-106-4-590-ECDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_139" title="Study 7: Hierarchical Preferences After Control Threat Are Not About Status">Study 7: Hierarchical Preferences After Control Threat Are Not About Status</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We have proposed that structure is the means by which hierarchies serve as a means of compensatory control, but it also seems plausible that the power and status offered by hierarchies to dominant individuals would be a means of restoring lost personal control (
        Inesi et al., 2011; 
        Keltner, Gruenfeld, &amp; Anderson, 2003). That is, it could be argued that the participants who lacked control preferred hierarchy because of the status it offers and that they were visualizing being in a high-status position. Although the lack of moderation by workplace status in Studies 2 and 4 suggests that even lower positioned employees preferred hierarchy more after threat, we more definitively rule out this alternative in Study 7.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Given that power is one means of achieving personal control (
        Inesi et al., 2011), any increased preference for hierarchy after control threat when individuals expect to be in dominant positions could be due to either the structure hierarchy offers or the power and status it offers. In contrast, any preference for hierarchy when individuals expect to be in subordinate positions is more consistent with a structure-based explanation (because structure is present at all levels of a hierarchy) than with a power/status-based explanation (because power and status are lacking in subordinate positions). Therefore, an especially strong test of our structure-seeking hypothesis would be to see whether personal control threat increases the appeal of hierarchy even when people expect to be in subordinate positions.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Our approach also further establishes that control and power are not fully interchangeable. The work by Rucker and colleagues (
        Rucker &amp; Galinsky, 2008, 
        2009; 
        Rucker, Dubois, &amp; Galinsky, 2011) shows that lacking power increases a desire for status objects because they signal to others a higher standing in the hierarchy. Thus, the primary need or concern one has when one lacks power is to restore one’s place in the social hierarchy. However, although loss of control and power are clearly related, lack of control does not threaten one’s hierarchical standing, and thus we did not expect status-seeking to be the primary engine for restoring a sense of control.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We also tested preference for hierarchy in a new domain, job selection. Jobs can differ in how much power and status they offer but also in whether they enhance or attenuate hierarchies. Hierarchy-enhancing jobs create or maintain group-based differences, and hierarchy-attenuating jobs diminish group-based differences (
        Pratto &amp; Espinoza, 2001; 
        Pratto, Stallworth, Sidanius, &amp; Siers, 1997). To the extent that personal control threats elicit needs for structure and to the extent that hierarchical jobs offer that structure regardless of one’s position within the hierarchy, people who lack control should show an increased interest in hierarchy-enhancing jobs even when those jobs are low in power and status.

          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Next, participants read short descriptions (2–3 sentences) of 20 different jobs from five occupations (advertising, public relations, real estate development, personnel management, and librarian).

            Pratto &amp; Espinoza, 2001; 
            Pratto et al., 1997) in which they were manipulated to be (a) hierarchy-enhancing or hierarchy-attenuating, and (b) high or low in power and status. We refer to the jobs with high power and status as high-position jobs and those low in power and status as low-position jobs. Within each occupation, there were four matched job descriptions corresponding to every combination of hierarchy and position. For example, within personnel management, the hierarchy-enhancing, high-position job was head of human resources with an emphasis on merit policies; the matched hierarchy-attenuating, high-position job was also head of human resources but with an emphasis on employment equity policies instead. Corresponding low-position jobs were human resources officers instead of department heads, again in either a hierarchy-enhancing merit role or a hierarchy-attenuating employment equity role. See the 
            Appendix for the list of job titles. Participants indicated whether each job was appealing with a single item using a 9-point scale (1 =

Consistent with this account, when personal control was threatened, participants perceived more hierarchy in ambiguous social interactions (Study 3) and reported increased support for hierarchies in organizations (Studies 4–5) and occupational choice (Study 7).</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The current studies also investigated a psychological mechanism for the link from control threat to hierarchical preferences: perceptions of structure. Hierarchy was perceived to be more structured than equality (Study 1), and perception that one’s workplace was a structured hierarchy was associated with enhanced feelings of job control (Study 2). Furthermore, hierarchical organizations were appealing to individuals high in a conceptually relevant individual difference, personal need for structure (Study 5). However, when hierarchy was depicted as less structured it was no longer appealing to those whose personal control was threatened (Study 6), and employees who worked in hierarchical organizations that they perceived as lacking procedural justice—an important component of organizational structure—reported feeling lower control (Study 2). These findings bolster our interpretation that structure is the psychologically attractive component of hierarchies for those who lack control.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Although past research has identified how hierarchies might serve as an means of personal control via the power they provide (
        Inesi et al., 2011; 
        Magee &amp; Galinsky, 2008), this is the first work to provide evidence for the specifically compensatory nature of hierarchies; that they are not just a means of personal control for people in high positions but may be an external source of structure for people across all positions in a hierarchy. This work is consistent with status compensation work (
        Rucker &amp; Galinsky, 2008, 
        2009; 
        Rucker et al., 2011) showing that lacking power increases a desire for status objects because they signal to others a higher standing in the hierarchy. When people lack control, they prefer hierarchy because of the structure it provides. When people lack power, they prefer high-status objects because of the hierarchical standing they provide. Loss of control does not threaten one’s hierarchical standing and thus we did not observe status seeking as a means for restoring a sense of control.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The current research supports functional accounts of hierarchies (
        Halevy et al., 2011; 
        Magee &amp; Galinsky 2008) by demonstrating that hierarchies not only enhance coordination and performance but also provide a psychological sense of structure. The current research also complements two prevailing theories of hierarchy maintenance, social dominance (
        Sidanius &amp; Pratto, 1999) and system justification (
        Jost, Banaji, &amp; Nosek, 2004; 
        Jost &amp; Banaji, 1994). Both of these theories provide thorough and insightful descriptions of how people respond to hierarchies and participate in them, but the current work differs from these theories in important ways. Social dominance theory emphasizes that hierarchy maintenance is driven by high-status groups’ desire to maintain their dominance and control of economic resources (
        Sidanius &amp; Pratto, 1999). In contrast, our work suggests that low-status groups may support hierarchies not because of imposed ideologies or the threat of force but because the social structure offered by hierarchies compensates for situations of low personal control.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">According to system justification theory, individuals will justify and maintain hierarchies to the extent that they are typically the status quo, due to overarching needs to perceive one’s social systems as legitimate (
        Jost &amp; Banaji, 1994; 
        Jost, Banaji &amp; Nosek, 2004). Our work suggests that hierarchy may have a particular psychological advantage over equality even when it is not the status quo. The need for structure may be an especially powerful explanation of hierarchy preference because this motive is not contingent on dominance concerns or status quo conditions but is a general psychological need held by both low-status and high-status group members. The desire to achieve structure through hierarchy can thus explain why people would be attracted to hierarchy even if they are in a relatively low social position or if hierarchy is not the status quo in their society or organization.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In other work, 
        Deutsch (1985) described the difficulty in awakening a sense of injustice among the oppressed. This desensitization to injustice is often driven by ideologies and myths that justify hierarchical social structures (e.g., that subordinate groups deserves their position; see also 
        Lane, 1959). Deutsch noted that the legitimacy of these hierarchy-sustaining ideologies must often be weakened before disadvantaged individuals will demand change. But if these weakened ideologies still serve disadvantaged individuals’ needs for structure, they may be motivated to retain them and the structures that produce them. This seems especially likely given that experiences of low personal control are common in the daily lives of subordinate groups and thus, presumably, needs for structure are often more chronically salient for them.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">This work also contributes to our theoretical understanding of how Personal Need for Structure (
        Neuberg &amp; Newsom, 1993) relates to ideologies of hierarchy maintenance such as social dominance orientation (SDO; 
        Pratto et al., 1994), right-wing authoritarianism (RWA; 
        Altemeyer, 1981), and political conservatism (
        Jost, Glaser, et al., 2003). Past work has shown correlationally that PNS produces prejudice and discrimination via mediation through SDO and RWA (e.g., 
        Altemeyer, 1998; 
        Heaven &amp; Bucci, 2001; 
        Van Hiel et al., 2004). The current work bolsters these findings by providing experimental evidence that motivational needs for structure may contribute, in part, to the attractiveness of hierarchy.
      </p><a id="psp-106-4-590-EBADA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Limitations and Future Directions</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The current studies used both direct (attitude) and indirect (job preference) operationalizations of preference for hierarchy across a variety of domains. However, all the studies used experimental manipulations that depended on recalling a time when one lacked control or reading articles that claimed the world is uncontrolled. These manipulations are well validated and have been shown to induce compensatory control strivings and a search for structure. Nonetheless, future research should consider alternative ways of manipulating the need for control. Future research might also explore these processes in the field, looking for natural experiments of control threat and testing for hierarchical preferences in actual organizations and social settings. These studies explored the link between personal control and hierarchy within workplace and job selection contexts, but it remains to be seen whether this process generalizes to other domains such as political and public policy contexts. Last, we conducted all of these studies online using samples of American adults. This allowed us to recruit individuals with more employment experience than typical undergraduate samples, thereby increasing the generalizability of our findings, but future research would do well to include complementary laboratory methodology and test these relationships in other cultural samples.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We have argued that people who lack control seek out structure in their social environments and thus prefer hierarchies because they offer structure. It is possible, however, that the control threats that we used induced a need for power or status in our participants. If so, participants might have preferred hierarchy because it offered an opportunity to exercise power over others or to have high status. This account becomes less plausible when considering the studies as a whole. Study 7 in particular strongly suggests that preference for hierarchy induced by control threat cannot be reduced to needs for power because threatened participants increased their interest in hierarchy-enhancing jobs but not in high-position jobs that were not also hierarchy enhancing. Furthermore, the effects of control threat on hierarchy preference remained when status was controlled for (Study 4) and the effects of workplace hierarchy on self-efficacy occurred independent of status (Study 2). To be clear, support for hierarchy is almost certainly rooted in needs for power and status under many circumstances, and gaining power might be an effective means of reasserting personal control over one’s environment (
          Inesi et al., 2011); we suggest only that power strivings are not the lone explanation for the current findings. Future research could pit motivations for power and structure against one another to see how and under what circumstances each relates to preferences for hierarchy.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Given that hierarchy is an important feature of status quo social structures (
          Jost et al., 2003; 
          Sidanius &amp; Pratto, 1999), one might wonder whether the motivated hierarchy preference documented in the present studies is just a special case of motivated status quo preference. We believe that the weight of the evidence suggests that hierarchy’s connection with structure and its ability to promote self-efficacy, documented in Studies 1 and 2, motivate people to embrace hierarchy when their sense of control is threatened. For example, Study 6 manipulated the association of hierarchy with structure but did not manipulate its association with the status quo. The fact that control threat lowered participants’ preference for hierarchy when hierarchy was associated with disorder suggests that it is the association of hierarchy with order and not its association with the status quo that motivates people to embrace hierarchy when their control needs are high. Although the association of hierarchy with the status quo may be one reason that hierarchy is preferred when control is threatened, this association is not the only reason that control threat motivates hierarchy preference.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The current work did not investigate other similar existential motivations, such as needs for certainty (
          Hogg, 2007; 
          McGregor, Zanna, Holmes, &amp; Spencer, 2001; 
          van den Bos, 2009), meaning (
          Heine, Proulx, &amp; Vohs, 2006), and symbolic immortality (
          Solomon, Greenberg, &amp; Pyszczynski, 2004). Although threats to personal control have specific and distinguishable effects that are distinct from these other motivations (
          Shepherd et al., 2011), it is plausible that support for hierarchies might also be driven by psychological needs such as these (e.g., 
          Rast, Hogg, &amp; Giessner, 2012).
        </p><a id="psp-106-4-590-EAADA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In Search of Egalitarianism</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Is hierarchy better or worse than equality? Hierarchy is often rife with unfairness and undeserved advantage that can be daunting to challenge. Yet, for some organizational tasks or goals it may also be more efficient than flatter forms of social organization (
          Abramitzky, 2011; 
          Halevy et al., 2011, 
          2012; 
          Ronay et al., 2012; 
          Tiedens et al., 2007; 
          Zitek &amp; Tiedens, 2012; but see 
          Deutsch, 1985, 
          2006; 
          Maner &amp; Mead, 2010). Activists who seek to dismantle illegitimate hierarchies should differentiate between the hierarchies they oppose and hierarchies that are fair and efficient. However, such social arrangements may be less able to serve as a source of structure in times of low personal control.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Our research suggests these attempts to flatten hierarchies (e.g., 
          Kay et al., 2009; 
          Shaer, 2013; 
          Silverman, 2012; 
          Worthy, 1950) will face numerous obstacles, even purely psychological ones, because equality is less appealing as a means of offering structure than hierarchical differentiation. Yet, our findings also suggest framing strategies that egalitarian reformers might use to counteract resistance stemming from unfulfilled control needs. Study 6 shows that a strategy of highlighting the ways that hierarchy can be unpredictable and disorderly can convert the need for control from being a barrier to being an incentive for supporting egalitarian reform. A second strategy would be to highlight ways that structure and order can be achieved in nonhierarchical designs of organizations and institutions. A third strategy would be to make sure to always affirm an audience’s personal control resources whenever proposing egalitarian reforms. Egalitarian reform advocates should expect little success at winning over adherents to their cause if they neglect to use these or some other strategy to address their audience’s control needs.

          6 (α = .92) before any manipulations to control for its effect. Zero-order correlations showed that SDO was positively but marginally associated with job appeal for the hierarchy-enhancing jobs,
