Three studies showed that when social adversity is common—at the transition to high school—an entity theory can affect overall stress, health, and achievement. Study 1 showed that an entity theory of personality, measured during the 1st month of 9th grade, predicted more negative immediate reactions to social adversity and, at the end of the year, greater stress, poorer health, and lower grades in school. Studies 2 and 3, both experiments, tested a brief intervention that taught a malleable (incremental) theory of personality—the belief that people can change. The incremental theory group showed less negative reactions to an immediate experience of social adversity and, 8 months later, reported lower overall stress and physical illness. They also achieved better academic performance over the year. Discussion centers on the power of targeted psychological interventions to effect far-reaching and long-term change by shifting interpretations of recurring adversities during developmental transitions.

Iconic films such as 
        <em>The Breakfast Club</em> (
        Tanen &amp; Hughes, 1985) or 
        <em>Back to the Future</em> (
        Gale, Canton, &amp; Zemeckis, 1985) depict teens as indelibly marked as “losers,” “jocks,” or “bullies”—labels that are thought to haunt them or buoy them throughout high school and into adulthood. Contemporary news outlets reinforce this belief. For instance, 
        <em>Newsweek Magazine</em> stated that “the labels we get as teenagers shape the rest of our lives” (
        Dailey, 2010, p. 1), while 
        <em>New York Magazine</em> explained “why you never truly leave high school” (
        Senior, 2013, p. 1). Are these beliefs innocuous or could they be harmful? It is possible that if a teen believed that social attributes were set for life in high school, their worries about these attributes, whether founded or unfounded, could have negative long-term consequences. And perhaps these consequences could extend beyond their social lives into other domains, such as overall life stress, physical health or academic achievement.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Past research has shown that 
        <em>implicit theories of personality</em>—beliefs about whether people’s attributes are fixed or are malleable—have domain-specific effects (e.g., 
        Chiu, Dweck, Tong, &amp; Fu, 1997; 
        Chiu, Hong, &amp; Dweck, 1997; 
        Yeager, Trzesniewski, &amp; Dweck, 2013; 
        Yeager, Trzesniewski, Tirri, Nokelainen, &amp; Dweck, 2011; see 
        Molden &amp; Dweck, 2006; also see 
        Finkel, Burnette, &amp; Scissors, 2007; 
        Knee, 1998). Across a variety of situations and populations, those who hold more of an 
        <em>entity theory</em> of personality—the belief that personal characteristics are fixed—show more negative reactions to social adversities such as exclusion (see 
        Yeager &amp; Dweck, 2012). For instance, children and adolescents with more of an entity theory react to social exclusion by feeling worse about themselves (
        Yeager et al., 2011; see also 
        Rudolph, 2010) and making more self-blaming attributions, such as “maybe I’m not a likable person” (
        Erdley, Cain, Loomis, Dumas-Hines, &amp; Dweck, 1997). Furthermore, experimental manipulations have shown this is a causal process. Teaching an 
        <em>incremental theory</em> of personality—the belief that people have the potential to change—reduces negative reactions to social adversity, including shame and aggressive retaliation (
        Yeager, Miu, Powers, &amp; Dweck, 2013; 
        Yeager et al., 2011). Overall, this research has found consistent effects of implicit theories of personality on relevant measures of hostile social cognition and behavior.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">However, the full importance of these findings has not yet been determined because it is not known how far-reaching these effects might be. It is possible that implicit theories—involving beliefs about whether people’s attributes are fixed or are malleable—could cause more global, long-term patterns of adjustment in areas that on their surface have very little to do with perceptions of personality traits. We suggest that implicit theories may create an interpretive framework that, during times of social difficulty, could have consequences for diverse domains of functioning. For instance, the transition to high school is laden with social adversities such as peer exclusion (
        Barber &amp; Olsen, 2004; 
        Crosnoe, 2011), and it is also a time during which stress increases while health and achievement decline (
        Benner, 2011; 
        Haugland, Wold, Stevenson, Aaroe, &amp; Woynarowska, 2001; 
        Sundblad, Jansson, Saartok, Renström, &amp; Engström, 2008). Stress, health, and underachievement are outcomes that independently represent major research priorities, difficult to understand and address in their own right. Yet implicit theories might tap into a social-cognitive “hub” from which these outcomes emerge (also see 
        G. L. Cohen &amp; Sherman, 2014; 
        Inzlicht &amp; Kang, 2010; 
        Walton &amp; Cohen, 2011). To our knowledge, no previous theory or data have shown a belief about the malleability of social attributes simultaneously has an influence on all of these consequential outcomes.

        Blackwell, Trzesniewski, &amp; Dweck, 2007) and social characteristics, such as personality (
        Chiu, Hong, &amp; Dweck, 1997; 
        Yeager et al., 2011), moral character (
        Chiu, Dweck, Tong, &amp; Fu, 1997), or shyness (
        Beer, 2002; also see 
        Finkel et al., 2007; 
        Rudolph, 2010). Broadly, implicit theories in these domains create psychological worlds or “meaning systems” that affect self-regulation and behavior by shaping how information is processed (
        Molden &amp; Dweck, 2006).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">When individuals are not experiencing any difficulty, implicit theories are not strongly predictive of self-regulation and behavior (for a meta-analysis, see 
        Burnette, O’Boyle, VanEpps, Pollack, &amp; Finkel, 2013). Just as the belief that intelligence is fixed is not threatening when school is easy (
        Blackwell et al., 2007), the belief that people’s socially relevant characteristics are fixed is not likely to lead to helplessness when there is no threat to one’s social status (see 
        Chen, DeWall, Poon, &amp; Chen, 2012). However, during times of difficulty, the different psychological worlds created by entity versus incremental theories can lead to divergent coping and resilience-related behaviors (
        Blackwell et al., 2007; see 
        Yeager &amp; Dweck, 2012; also see 
        Mueller &amp; Dweck, 1998). In response to exclusion or bullying, an entity theory—with its focus on static traits and its tendency to view small behaviors as diagnostic of global traits—can lead to the judgment that those who behave aggressively are “bad people” and that a rejected person is “a loser” (
        Erdley et al., 1997; 
        Erdley &amp; Dweck, 1993; 
        Yeager et al., 2011). These types of attributions compromise resilience by putting individuals in a world in which negative people or circumstances seem set in stone (
        Graham &amp; Juvonen, 1998). As a result, individuals with more of an entity theory tend to experience more shame, harbor grudges, and seek aggressive revenge (
        Yeager et al., 2011; 
        Yeager, Trzesniewski, &amp; Dweck, 2013; also see 
        Finkel et al., 2007).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Nearly all this research, however, has focused on implicit theories and resilience within a given domain, such as the effect of implicit theories of intelligence on academic achievement (
        Blackwell et al., 2007; for a meta-analysis, see 
        Burnette et al., 2013) or the effect of implicit theories of socially relevant personality traits on aggression in response to a social conflict (e.g., 
        Yeager et al., 2011; 
        Yeager, Trzesniewski, &amp; Dweck, 2013; also see 
        Chen et al., 2012). The present research extends these ideas by suggesting that when individuals are in a developmental period during which social adversity is chronic and widespread, then there may be important spillover effects of implicit theories of personality into a number of discrete domains of functioning (cf. 
        Inzlicht &amp; Kang, 2010). While it would be possible to test this hypothesis during any such developmental period, below we outline why the transition to high school is one appropriate period during which to do this.
      </p><a id="psp-106-6-867-EIDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_13" title="The Transition to High School Is an Appropriate Time to Measure and Change Implicit Theories">The Transition to High School Is an Appropriate Time to Measure and Change Implicit Theories</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">All life transitions have the potential to affect a person’s social life, but the transition to high school can be especially difficult for several reasons. First, moving into high school frequently disrupts social networks, as old friendships are lost and new ones must be created (
        Cairns &amp; Cairns, 1994). For instance, during the first year of high school, roughly 50% of casual friendships are different from 1 month to the next (
        Chan &amp; Poulin, 2007). This can make social status precarious. Students often turn to aggression and exclusion as a means of shoring up their social status (
        G. L. Cohen &amp; Prinstein, 2006; 
        Faris &amp; Felmlee, 2011; see 
        Pellegrini &amp; Long, 2002). In the face of this social reality, adolescents can understandably be anxious about threats to their social status coming from exclusion or other forms of aggression, even if they themselves are not directly victimized (
        Juvonen &amp; Graham, 2014).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Second, experience-sampling studies also suggest that adolescents become preoccupied with peer relationships. These studies find that the percentage of time thinking about peer relationships rises dramatically as teens move into high school (e.g., 
        Richards, Crowe, Larson, &amp; Swarr, 1998).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Third, the threat that social adversity poses may be heightened by the social-cognitive changes that lead adolescents to interpret adversity in more problematic ways. High school-aged adolescents, relative to children or younger adolescents, increasingly come to believe that social attributes are fixed entities that cannot change (e.g., 
        Killen, Kelly, Richardson, &amp; Jampol, 2010). For instance, older adolescents rely more on traits such as niceness or meanness as a way of classifying peers, relative to younger children (e.g., 
        Birnbaum, Deeb, Segall, Ben-Eliyahu, &amp; Diesendruck, 2010; 
        Diesendruck &amp; haLevi, 2006). Thus, adolescents entering high school are both in a context that requires them to be more vigilant to threats to their social status, and they hold more implicit theories that make these threats seem more constant.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In summary, the changes common to the transition to high school—the increased uncertainty of peer relationships, the heightened preoccupation with peer relationships, and the growing view of personality traits as fixed—make it an appropriate developmental period to test whether the effects of implicit theories of personality generalize beyond reactions to social adversity and extend to adjustment in multiple domains of functioning.</p><a id="psp-106-6-867-EHDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_19" title="Stress, Health, and Achievement">Stress, Health, and Achievement</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Here we review the rationale for our specific predictions regarding the effects of implicit theories on stress, health, and achievement during the transition to high school.</p><a id="psp-106-6-867-ECHDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Stress</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Stress is defined as the sense that the demands in one’s environment are greater than one’s ability to cope with them (
          Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1984), and past research has found that stress is greatest when ambiguity and uncertainty about social status are high, such as when social hierarchies are uprooted (for a review of the primate and human literature, see 
          Sapolsky, 2005; also see 
          Gould, 2003). This perfectly describes adolescent life during the transition to high school (
          Juvonen &amp; Graham, 2014). However, not all adolescents will experience the transition to high school as equally stressful. Social-cognitive theories of development emphasize that adverse experiences, such peer exclusion or victimization, do not always undermine long-term adjustment. This is because the interpretations of these adversities matter (
          Olson &amp; Dweck, 2008; for a classic formulation in the context of depression, see 
          Beck, 1967). From this social-cognitive perspective, adolescents who draw problematic conclusions from their social adversities—for instance, believing exclusion means they are a “loser” who will never be included—will tend to appraise them as more stressful. Hence, life overall might be experienced as more stressful for high school adolescents who interpret social failures through the lens of an entity theory (e.g., 
          Erdley et al., 1997). If so, then perhaps an intervention designed to teach adolescents a different interpretation of adversity—one growing out of an incremental theory of personality—could reduce overall levels of stress in life.
        </p><a id="psp-106-6-867-EBHDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Physical Health</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The social adversities common in unstable social hierarchies also pose a greater likelihood of poor physical health (see 
          Sapolsky, 2005). This is because chronic stress can produce physiological changes that undermine the immune system (see 
          Miller, Chen, &amp; Cole, 2009; 
          Sapolsky, 2005). Not surprisingly, then, large-sample correlational studies find that experiences of peer social adversity during childhood or adolescence predict poorer health (
          Gini &amp; Pozzoli, 2009), and this effect can persist long into adulthood (
          Wolke, Copeland, Angold, &amp; Costello, 2013). Additionally, blaming one’s own character for social difficulties is associated with physical health symptoms (see 
          Dickerson, Gruenewald, &amp; Kemeny, 2011). Thus, it is possible that an intervention targeting implicit theories, which lessens negative reactions such as shame when social status comes under attack (
          Yeager et al., 2011), could, over time, result in reports of better health among teens making the transition to high school.
        </p><a id="psp-106-6-867-EAHDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Academic Achievement</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Finally, social adversities such as exclusion could undermine academic achievement for several reasons. Hormones commonly elicited by social stressors such as peer dominance can have a direct effect on the brain’s ability to form connections and create new memories following a learning task (see 
          Lupien, Maheu, Tu, Fiocco, &amp; Schramek, 2007). In addition, when social threats are chronic—as they often are during the transition to high school—the vigilance required to monitor one’s social status might monopolize attention, impairing the ability to focus on academic content (
          Guinote, 2007a, 
          2007b), engage in abstract learning (
          Smith &amp; Trope, 2006), and make strategic decisions that benefit long-term self-interests (
          Smith, Jostman, Galinsky, &amp; van Dijk, 2008). Furthermore, ninth-grade students who believe that bullying is prevalent at their high school—even if they themselves are not bullied—are less likely to be committed to doing well at that school, disagreeing with items such as “I try hard at school” (
          Mehta, Cornell, Fan, &amp; Gregory, 2013). Perhaps an entity theory, beyond exacerbating the subjective experience of common social adversities, could impair learning, attention, and engagement, resulting in lower academic performance over the year. Relatedly, perhaps an appropriately timed nudge in the direction of an incremental theory of personality could reduce this hypervigilance. This might allow adolescents to focus on and engage more effectively with their schoolwork, resulting in better grades over the year.
        </p><a id="psp-106-6-867-EGDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_28" title="The Importance of Longitudinal Field Experiments for Testing Basic Psychological Theory">The Importance of Longitudinal Field Experiments for Testing Basic Psychological Theory</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Our research rests on the recognition that social-psychological processes have a temporal dimension—that they do not end with the first outcome assessed but instead can continue to unfold over time (
        G. L. Cohen &amp; Garcia, 2008; 
        G. L. Cohen &amp; Sherman, 2014; 
        Lewin, 1943; also see 
        Reis &amp; Gosling, 2010; 
        Ross &amp; Nisbett, 1991; 
        Wilson, 2006; 
        Yeager &amp; Walton, 2011). Building on this, the present research tests the hypothesis that interpretations of social adversity arising from implicit theories trigger accumulating consequences. Over time, these lead to divergent levels of stress, health and academic achievement. Following recommendations from 
        Lewin (1952) and 
        Bronfenbrenner (1979), we use longitudinal field experiments to test this. A presumption of this research is that a brief but theoretically informed intervention could have effects that persist many months later (e.g., 
        G. L. Cohen, Garcia, Purdie-Vaugns, Apfel, &amp; Brzustoski, 2009; 
        Finkel, Slotter, Luchies, Walton, &amp; Gross, in press; 
        Sherman et al., 2013; 
        Walton &amp; Cohen, 2011; see 
        Garcia &amp; Cohen, 2012; 
        Walton, in press; 
        Wilson, 2006; 
        Yeager &amp; Walton, 2011). It could do so by changing a key force in a “tension system”—the network of interacting forces that drive behavior in a social environment (
        Bronfenbrenner, 1979; 
        Lewin, 1952; 
        Ross &amp; Nisbett, 1991). Such a key force might be a psychological tendency that asserts its influence repeatedly, such as a tendency to interpret social adversity as fixed rather than changeable (
        Abelson, 1985; 
        Yeager et al., in press). Intervention experiments can inform theory because they can test whether a given psychological tendency is truly influential in a given real-world tension system that abounds with uncontrolled and powerful forces affecting behavior (see 
        Cialdini &amp; Paluck, in press; 
        Reis &amp; Gosling, 2010). An additional advantage of intervention experiments is that they can directly inform efforts to address major social issues (
        Cialdini &amp; Paluck, in press; 
        Wilson, 2006)—in the present case, social coping, stress, health, and academic underachievement during a difficult adolescent transition.

Several comprehensive early childhood interventions lasting several years and costing many thousands of dollars per person such as Perry Preschool or the Abecedarian Project have successfully produced cross-domain effects (
        Heckman &amp; Kautz, in press). Yet the track record is much more disappointing for similarly comprehensive and expensive adult or adolescent interventions explicitly designed to produce cross-domain effects. For instance, 
        Heckman and Kautz (in press) reviewed a large number of diverse adolescent interventions, including interventions providing counseling, career and college readiness skills, and improved nutrition. They did not find a single example of a program that positively affected both educational outcomes and health outcomes upon longitudinal follow-up. However, these past interventions, often involving long-term training or residency programs, were not built on precise social-psychological theory.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The present research provides a test of the general question of whether it is possible for a theory-based adolescent intervention to have effects on stress, health, and academic achievement. This possibility rests on the finding that social relationships have wide-ranging downstream consequences (
        Cacioppo &amp; Patrick, 2008; also see 
        Walton &amp; Cohen, 2011). Thus, the present research is an opportunity to assess the power of precise psychological theory to make progress where more traditional human capital interventions have hit an impasse.

The first study asked whether there is correlational evidence that an entity theory of personality predicts adjustment across a variety of domains during the transition to high school—specifically, responses to social adversity and levels of stress, health, and academic achievement. This longitudinal study measured implicit theories and responses to social adversity in the first month of school and then examined associations with year-end levels of these adjustment measures, controlling for initial levels.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The second study used a randomized experiment to address the causal role of implicit theories. During the first month of high school we delivered an intervention that taught students an incremental theory of personality. We used a double-blind experiment to assess its impact on immediate reactions to social adversity and its longer-term impact on stress, physical health, and academic achievement. In Study 3, we replicated the intervention in a new context—a low-income, predominately ethnic minority urban public high school—to assess the generality of the processes. This study also explored potential long-term effects on adolescents’ construals of themselves, to begin to understand how and why an implicit theories intervention might have a lasting impact.

            <em>N</em> = 158). Eight percent of students received free or reduced-price lunch, a measure of low socioeconomic status. Forty-four percent of participants were White, 41% Asian, 13% Latino, and 2% another racial or ethnic group. Forty-four percent were female. Social adversities were common. On a survey conducted in the third week of the school year, many students (77%) already reported being the victim of at least some physical, verbal, or social aggression.
            <a id="b-fn2"> </a><sup /> Some students did not provide data at both assessments, and so degrees of freedom varied across analyses.
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">During the first week of the school year in September, parental consent was obtained for all students. In the third week, students assented and completed an initial survey measuring implicit theories of personality, baseline levels of global psychological stress and reported physical health, and background characteristics. One week later students came to the school’s computer lab, where they participated in an established protocol for eliciting feelings of social exclusion (described below). After the task, participants reported their responses to the event. In May, at the end of the school year, students were again surveyed to measure their global stress and physical illness symptoms. After the school year, official grades were collected from the school’s registrar.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Experience of peer exclusion</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">To elicit reactions to social exclusion, students participated in a standard laboratory experience of exclusion—the “Cyberball” paradigm (
            Williams &amp; Jarvis, 2006). Cyberball is a short-lived and ultimately harmless instance of social exclusion (
            Williams, 2009) and involves an online game of catch with two “peers” purportedly from the students’ school.
            <a id="b-fn3"> </a><sup /></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The task was programmed so that at first the other “players” threw the ball to the participant twice. Then, for the remaining minutes of the task, the other players threw it exclusively to each other and not to the participant. Immediately following this, dependent variables were assessed.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We took several precautions to make the exclusion experience ultimately innocuous. Specifically, after completing initial dependent variables, participants saw an “error” box appear on the screen informing them that there had been a glitch in the first round such that the other Cyberball players were not able to see their icon and therefore could not throw the ball to them. They were asked to play again, and this time, participants were fully included in the game of catch. At this point participants answered a number of generic open-ended questions that were later coded to assess suspicion (e.g., “Is there anything you’d like to share with the research team?”). After the entire session was completed, research assistants informed the class that in fact Cyberball had been created by researchers in order to understand exclusion in high school and that no one had actually been excluded. Assistants answered students’ questions about the task. Students in general saw the value of the task and many spontaneously said that they were glad to have participated in the study and contributed to science.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">To minimize any possibility of participants informing other students about the true purpose of the study, all participants were run through the study in 1 day, in back-to-back classes in three different computer labs in each class period. Beyond the open-ended questions described previously, the survey asked students if they had heard anything about the study before entering the classroom and, if so, what they had heard. Participants’ responses to these and all other open-ended questions were reliably coded by research assistants. Twenty-two students suspected that the Cyberball task was being controlled by the computer, either because they had been informed by a peer (four students) or because they did not believe the cover story (18 students). These students were excluded only from analyses of responses to Cyberball. Throughout the article, students were reliably coded as suspicious or not about the Cyberball task by two independent coders (blind to identities and characteristics of students) on the basis of participants’ open-ended responses to questions in the posttask survey (Krippendorff’s α &gt; .81). Suspicion was uncorrelated with all measured variables.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Measures</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><em>Implicit theories of personality</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">On the initial survey in September of ninth grade, students were given four items used in previous research to assess adolescents’ implicit theories of personality (
              Yeager et al., 2011; e.g., “Bullies and victims are types of people who really can’t be changed”; 1 = 
              <em>Strongly disagree</em> to 6 = 
              <em>Strongly agree</em>). Responses were averaged (α = .81), and higher values corresponded to stronger endorsement of an entity theory.
            </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><em>Negative reactions to social exclusion</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">One week after the initial survey, participants underwent the Cyberball procedure and reported how they reacted to it (three items: “How much stress were you feeling when playing Cyberball?” “How much anxiety were you feeling when playing Cyberball?” “How good or bad were you feeling about yourself when playing Cyberball?”) on fully labeled 7-point scales, with 7 corresponding to the most negative responses (e.g., 
              <em>An extreme amount</em> of stress or feeling 
              <em>Extremely bad</em> about yourself). In this study and throughout the article, the items were averaged (α = .75), then log-transformed to reduce significant skew and converted to 
              <em>z</em>-scores for ease of interpretation (the joint test of both skew and kurtosis for the untransformed metric was significant at 
              <em>p</em> &lt; .0000001, and “ladder of powers” analyses revealed that the log transformation improved normality the most).
            </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><em>Global psychological stress</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">First on the initial survey and then again at the end of the year, participants completed the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (
              S. Cohen, Kamarck, &amp; Mermelstein, 1983). This scale measures global appraisals that situations in one’s life are stressful and beyond one’s ability to cope with them (e.g., “In the last month, how often have you felt difficulties were piling up so high that you could not overcome them?”). These items, each rated on a fully labeled 5-point scale (1 = 
              <em>Never</em>, 5 = 
              <em>Very often</em>), were averaged (α = .83).
            </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><em>Physical health</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We sought to measure the extent to which adolescents were sick to the point that it affected the quality of their daily lives. To examine whether symptom levels were of this magnitude, we adapted a subset of items from the validated Medical Outcomes Study core measures of health-related quality of life (
              Hays, Sherbourne, &amp; Mazel, 1993). In the form of this survey intended for adults, items ask whether physical health symptoms limit one’s role at work; in a validation study, such items were the highest-loading items on a global factor of physical health (
              Hays et al., 1993). In the present study, minor edits were made to make these items relevant for adolescents. Three items assessed complaints that feeling “sick, tired, or in pain” interfered with “schoolwork or other regular daily activities” in the past 4 weeks (e.g., whether they “cut down the amount of time” spent on daily activities due to illness; for each, 1 = 
              <em>Yes</em>, 0 = 
              <em>No</em>; items were summed; range = 0–3; α = .78).

              <em>Never</em>, and 4 = 
              <em>All the time</em>; ratings were then averaged). From school records, we obtained grades earned the prior year, in eighth grade.

To examine associations with academic achievement, three-level hierarchical linear models with grading period and school subject nested within students were estimated using the 
          <em>lme4</em> package in R (in these models, 
          <em>p</em>-values for significance tests were estimated using Monte Carlo sampling, following best practices; 
          Bates, 2010). All analyses controlled for student sex and race/ethnicity. For tables reporting results that do not include these covariates, and tables reporting results of regression models used in exploratory mediational analyses, see the online supplemental materials. These do not differ in their overall pattern of statistical significance. In this study and throughout the article, all means, standard deviations, and proportions reported in the text are raw, unadjusted numbers. All test statistics (

            <em>t</em>(138) = 3.03, 
            <em>p</em> = .003, β = .20 (see 
            Table 1). Adolescents with more of an entity theory of personality at the beginning of the year also reported poorer physical health at the end of the school year (i.e., more complaints that physical illness impaired daily functioning), 
            <em>b</em> = .27, 
            <em>t</em>(139) = 2.37, 
            <em>p</em> = .02, β = .19, again controlling for initial levels. Finally, stronger endorsement of an entity theory predicted lower grades over ninth grade (averaging across math, science, and English), 
            <em>b</em> = −.18, 
            <em>t</em>(157) = −3.10, 
            <em>p</em> &lt; .001, β = −.16, controlling for eighth-grade achievement. Illustrating this finding, adolescents who held an entity theory at baseline (who “agreed,” on average, with the entity theory questions, i.e., average score &gt;3.5 on the 1–6 scale) had a cumulative grade point average of 2.62, compared with a grade point average of 3.08 among those who did not endorse an entity theory (≤3.5 on the 1–6 scale).
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In summary, an entity theory of personality—which was measured during a student’s first weeks in high school–predicted not only more negative short-term reactions to social adversity (a domain-specific effect) but also greater stress, worse health, and lower grades over the course of the year, controlling for initial levels of these variables. This suggests that implicit theories may have longer term, cross-domain implications during a socially difficult adolescent transition.

We therefore considered the possibility that negative reactions to Cyberball exclusion (i.e., reporting more stress, anxiety, and negative self-feelings) might statistically mediate the link between implicit theories and measures of overall adjustment across domains. If this were the case, it might suggest that reactions to social adversity fed into changes in the other variables over time. Consistent with this expectation, correlation analyses found that more negative reactions to Cyberball exclusion in the first month of school significantly predicted year-end levels of global stress (
            <em>r</em> = .31, 
            <em>p</em> &lt; .001) and poorer physical health (
            <em>r</em> = .24, 
            <em>p</em> = .002). In mediational analyses (
            Imai, Keele, &amp; Tingley, 2010; 
            Imai, Keele, Tingley, &amp; Yamamoto, 2010), there was a significant indirect (mediated) effect of implicit theories through Cyberball reactions on global stress (
            <em>b</em> = .05, Quasi-Bayesian 95% confidence interval [CI]: .02, .10) and physical health (
            <em>b</em> = .06, 95% CI: .01, .14). We did not find that our measure of reactions to Cyberball exclusion mediated the effect on academic achievement (negative reactions to exclusion were uncorrelated with grades in either term, 
            <em>r</em>s &lt; .05, 
            <em>p</em>s &gt; .8).
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In sum, we found significant evidence for mediation by negative reactions to Cyberball exclusion for global stress and physical health. Mediation by Cyberball was not apparent for grades.</p><a id="psp-106-6-867-ECDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_75" title="Study 2">Study 2</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Study 1 was a preliminary correlational longitudinal study showing that an entity theory of personality (the belief that people’s traits are fixed) is associated with harsher immediate reactions to social exclusion and also to longer-term differences in overall adjustment across multiple domains over the school year. Clearly, however, an experiment with random assignment to condition is needed to speak to the causal role of implicit theories. Therefore in Studies 2 and 3 we administered an incremental theory intervention during the first month of high school. The intervention was designed to redirect adolescents’ implicit theories away from an entity theory, so as to cut off cascading cycles of stress, illness and underperformance before they could gain momentum (cf. 
        Cook, Purdie-Vaughns, Garcia, &amp; Cohen, 2012; 
        Finkel et al., in press; 
        Sherman et al., 2013). Mirroring Study 1, we first tested whether the intervention lessened negative reactions to social exclusion—how much stress, anxiety, and negative self-feelings participants report experiencing after being excluded. We then assessed whether implicit theories affected long-term global stress, physical health, and grades.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Aside from the intervention’s ability to illuminate the causal relation between implicit theories and adjustment, the present longitudinal field experiment is unique in several regards. First, past implicit theories of personality interventions looked chiefly at social outcomes, such as emotional and attributional reactions to social exclusion (
        Yeager et al., 2011), aggressive retaliation (
        Yeager, Trzesniewski, &amp; Dweck, 2013), or misconduct in school (
        Yeager, Trzesniewski, &amp; Dweck, 2013). By contrast, we test for wide-ranging effects on stress, health and academic achievement. Second, in contrast to previous research, the present study used a precise and light-touch intervention to manipulate incremental theories. A past intervention used six facilitated classroom workshops to alter adolescents’ implicit theories of personality (
        Yeager, Trzesniewski, &amp; Dweck, 2013). However, this past intervention involved many elements (e.g., lectures, discussion groups, skits). It is unknown whether a briefer intervention that more precisely and efficiently communicates the incremental theory could alter outcomes in the long term, with no reinforcement.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In addition, no past control condition in an implicit theories of personality experiment has taught a message about growth. Past control conditions taught helpful skills (
        Yeager, Trzesniewski, &amp; Dweck, 2013) and/or delivered no message (
        Yeager et al., 2011; 
        Yeager, Trzesniewski, &amp; Dweck, 2013). An important extension of the present research is to rule out the possibility that 
        <em>any</em> optimistic message of growth—whether it addresses personality traits or not—could promote positive outcomes across domains. We compare an incremental theory of personality to an incremental theory about an important area that is thought to be unrelated to responses to social exclusion.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Finally, we conducted this research during the first few weeks of ninth grade. This is because of past theory and research demonstrating the recursive nature of social and academic life, with early successes, failures, relationships and resources affecting later ones (
        G. L. Cohen &amp; Sherman, 2014; 
        Garcia &amp; Cohen, 2012; 
        Yeager &amp; Walton, 2011). Indeed, 
        Cook et al. (2012) conducted a brief psychological intervention (a values affirmation) and manipulated timing within the school year. These authors showed that the brief intervention delivered early in the school year improved students’ grades significantly more than the same intervention delivered just a few weeks later (also see meta-analytic evidence from 
        Raudenbush, 1984). Building on this, the present intervention sought to change implicit theories in the first few weeks of the first year of high school, to slow or stop any possible negative recursive processes.
      </p><a id="psp-106-6-867-EBCDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Study 2 was conducted in a school similar to the one used in Study 1. Participants were all the ninth-grade students enrolled in Algebra I at a high school in Northern California (
            <em>N</em> = 82), and so sample size was determined by the school setting. All but four participants provided data at the long-term follow-up, leaving 
            <em>N</em> = 78 for analysis. No other participants were excluded. One percent of students were eligible for free or reduced-price lunch. Participants were 44% White, 44% Asian American, and 12% Latino. In this school, only lower performing students took Algebra I, with the majority of ninth graders taking Algebra II. Hence this sample was academically at-risk relative to the school population. It might more readily show the impact of an incremental theory intervention on their grades because they should be less affected by range restrictions (i.e., students with all “A” grades cannot improve).
            <a id="b-fn5"> </a><sup /></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The procedures were similar to those in Study 1. A baseline survey was administered in the third week of the school year, in September, as was the implicit theories of personality intervention. One to 2 days later, negative reactions to exclusion due to the Cyberball protocol and postintervention implicit theories were measured. A survey assessing global stress and health was administered in May, and grades for the year were obtained from the registrar. Unfortunately baseline levels of stress and health were not assessed. The implicit theories of personality intervention was the only manipulation in this study (and in Study 3).</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Intervention</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The intervention procedure is described in greater detail in the online supplement. Here, we provide an overview.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">As a preface to the intervention, during the first week of school, Algebra I teachers gave an overview to both the experimental and control groups of how the brain changes and learns. About 2 weeks later, 1 week after the baseline survey, researchers came into the classroom. They handed out envelopes containing either an experimental intervention or a control activity, which was randomly assigned at the individual level, with researchers blind to condition. Students completed it silently during class time, and it took roughly 25 min. Importantly, teachers were kept blind to study hypotheses, message content and students’ experimental conditions.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The experimental intervention (incremental theory of personality) presented information in support of the idea that people have the potential to change and that therefore (a) if you are excluded or victimized, it is not due to a fixed, personal deficiency on your part, and (b) people who exclude or victimize you are not fixed, bad people but instead have complicated motivations that are subject to change. Students read a brief article summarizing actual neuroscience studies showing that people’s behaviors are controlled by “thoughts and feelings in their brains” and that such pathways in the brain can be changed. Next, participants read three quotes purportedly written by upperclassmen who had previously read the same article. The upperclassmen provided testimonials of how they used the information discussed in the article when they encountered a peer conflict. Finally, participants were asked to write their own version of such a narrative to share with future ninth graders, drawing on the examples they had just read from the upperclassmen or on their own experiences in high school or middle school. As in past interventions (e.g., 
            Yeager, Trzesniewski, &amp; Dweck, 2013), this is a “saying is believing” activity designed to promote the internalization of the intervention message (see 
            E. Aronson, 1999; 
            J. Aronson, Fried, &amp; Good, 2002; 
            Walton &amp; Cohen, 2011). After completing the one-time activity, it was not mentioned again to students by researchers or teachers.
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The control group activity was parallel but focused on the malleability of athletic ability—a nonpersonality area that was not thought to be as central to social adversity and therefore was not predicted to have widespread effects during times of social adversity.
            <a id="b-fn6"> </a><sup /> As noted, this was done to eliminate the possibility that simple optimism about the potential for growth in any important area might account for our results. Although one way to test the incremental theory of personality intervention would be to compare it to an entity theory intervention, this condition was precluded for obvious ethical reasons.

Research assistants administering the task were blind to students’ experimental condition assignments. Five students’ Cyberball data were not analyzed due to suspicion that the Cyberball players were controlled by the computer—judgments that, as noted in Study 1, were made by coders blind to condition assignment or other participant characteristics. In this study and in Study 3, these judgments did not differ across conditions.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Measures</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The same measures of negative reactions to social exclusion (i.e., stress, anxiety, and overall negative feelings about the self), global psychological stress, and physical health, as described in Study 1 were again employed. In this study (and in Study 3) we were able to obtain preintervention (eighth grade) state test scores and combine these with preintervention grade point averages so as to more completely control for prior differences in achievement. These were converted to 
            <em>z</em>-scores and then averaged. In addition, in the present study more grading periods were available for analysis (three per semester, yielding six total over the year, rather than only the final semester grades used in Study 1). At each grading period, grades in the different subjects demonstrated acceptable internal consistency reliability (αs &gt; .72).
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">As a first manipulation check, two coders, blind to experimental hypotheses and to participant identities and characteristics, independently and reliably (Krippendorff’s α = .85) judged whether participants sufficiently answered the writing prompts in the intervention materials. This allowed us to assess whether the manipulation successfully elicited thinking that is in line with the incremental theory. When the coders disagreed, they were coached to agreement by a third blind coder.

            G. L. Cohen et al., 2009; 
            Finkel et al., in press). That is, 
            Figure 1 shows that in the months following the intervention, control-condition students showed a steep decline in performance, which is common for academically at-risk students during the transition to high school (
            Benner, 2011). The incremental theory intervention, however, softened the decline such that experimental condition students better maintained their grades over the year. This pattern of results is consistent with the notion that social and academic processes are interwoven and build on each other during difficult transition periods—and that appropriately timed psychological interventions can redirect interpretations of adversity and set in motion more beneficial, self-reinforcing processes across domains (see

            Langenkamp, 2011).

            Blackwell et al., 2007) has found evidence in the direction of larger treatment effects among those with an entity theory at baseline. This is sensible because those who hold an entity theory presumably have more to gain from learning an incremental theory than do those who already hold an incremental theory. Therefore our hypothesis was that the incremental theory of personality intervention would have the largest effects among those who began the year with an entity theory. In separate regressions, one for each outcome, we tested for Experimental Condition × Baseline implicit theories interactions. Surprisingly, in this study, none were significant (
            <em>t</em>s &gt; 1, 
            <em>p</em>s &gt; .3). That is, although we had predicted stronger effects among those who may need the incremental theory the most, it appeared, at least in this sample, that students across the implicit theories continuum benefited equally from the incremental message.
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Mediation</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Negative reactions to Cyberball exclusion significantly predicted year-end levels of global stress (
            <em>r</em> = .28, 
            <em>p</em> = .02), and mediated the effect of the treatment on stress (
            <em>b</em> = –.09, 95% CI –.21, –.002). Next, negative reactions to Cyberball exclusion did not significantly predict year-end health (
            <em>r</em> = .21, 
            <em>p</em> = .10). While Cyberball reactions did not significantly mediate the effect of the treatment effect on health (
            <em>b</em> = –.11, 95% CI –.34, .03), it is possible that this latter mediation failed to reach statistical significance due to lower statistical power than in Study 1. Indeed, the standardized indirect effect in the present study (β = .045), was nearly identical to the same indirect effect in Study 1 (β = .044).
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Analysis suggested that the effects of the intervention on grades were partially mediated by Cyberball reactions. In a hierarchical linear model, negative reactions to Cyberball at the beginning of the school year predicted grades over the year (β = .17, 
            <em>p</em> = .03), controlling for eighth-grade achievement. Next, controlling for Cyberball reactions reduced the treatment effect to nonsignificance (
            <em>p</em> = .13). We then conducted a “2-2-1” mediation model (
            Zhang, Zyphur, &amp; Preacher, 2009). In the present mediational model, the “Level 2” variable (implicit theories intervention) predicts another “Level 2” variable (Cyberball reactions), which in turn predicts the “Level 1” variable (grades). Because there is not a standard package to implement this model in 
            <em>R</em>, we wrote a custom bootstrapping program. When doing this, there was a significant indirect effect of the treatment on grades through Cyberball reactions (β = .04, bias-corrected and accelerated 95% CI: .029, .049). In sum, when looking broadly across Studies 1 and 2, in five out of six cases (four of which were significantly different from zero at 
            <em>p</em> &lt; .05) the mediational data were consistent with the idea that implicit theories could affect overall adjustment across domains by altering reactions to social exclusion.

The present study was a replication conducted a year later in a different school—one of the poorest-performing and lowest-income in California. Many researchers have recently emphasized the importance of exact replications for building a psychological science that maximizes reproducible findings (
        Schimmack, 2012; 
        Simmons, Nelson, &amp; Simonsohn, 2011). This study was designed to do this.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">At the same time, many factors could affect the likelihood of a replication in a new and different context. As 
        Lewin’s (1952) theory maintained, any psychological strategy to promote behavior change is embedded in a “tension system” of factors promoting and hindering behavior (
        G. L. Cohen &amp; Sherman, 2014; 
        Ross &amp; Nisbett, 1991). Often, psychological interventions such as that tested here assume that the system was poised for change, provided that thinking was redirected. When that is not the case, divergent results may emerge. Stated differently, brief psychological interventions that produce widespread and lasting treatment effects likely do so through a number of different, interconnected mediators that depend critically on context (cf. 
        Pennebaker &amp; Chung, 2011). When these intermediary processes are not present, or are not effectively altered, then an intervention might not produce either immediate or sustained change (
        G. L. Cohen &amp; Sherman, 2014).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Study 2 was conducted in a nonpoor, largely nonminority context, in which students on average experienced high quality instruction and are presumed to be safer in their neighborhoods relative to youth in less advantaged contexts. Yet perhaps in such a context social exclusion is a primary source of stress, meaning that a psychological intervention to take the edge off these experiences could transfer across multiple domains of functioning. However, many adolescents live in different settings—settings in which social adversity involving peers in school is just one stressor among many. It is unknown whether similar effects would be observed for youth with greater environmental stressors—for instance, racial minority youth living in high-poverty, high-violence neighborhoods with historically low levels of educational attainment. Perhaps the effect would be drowned out by competing adversities. Then again, perhaps social adversity matters as much or more in these contexts, and so an incremental theory intervention would have similar or larger effects. Altogether, the present study was designed to push the boundaries of the effect of implicit theories of personality to a new population, as an initial foray into examining the generality of the effect.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Finally, Study 3 involved exploratory analyses to extend theory about the role of implicit theories of personality in affecting the development of views about the self during adolescence. Following some recent research, we focus on students’ construals of themselves (
        Sherman et al., 2013). Key to our theory is research suggesting that those with more of an incremental theory of personality place greater emphasis on behaviors than on traits, because behaviors are more dynamic, context-sensitive and malleable (e.g., 
        Chiu, Hong, &amp; Dweck, 1997; also see 
        Molden &amp; Dweck, 2006). Perhaps students receiving the intervention would be more likely to see themselves in terms of actions as opposed to labels—as “doing” rather than “being.” To explore this we took advantage of a feature of the Study 3 baseline and follow-up surveys: a new warm-up question that asked participants to write about what people in school thought of them. This open-ended question was likely to elicit students’ construals of themselves and their social image. We coded students’ responses using the LIWC textual analysis software (
        Pennebaker, Francis, &amp; Booth, 2007) and analyzed the use of common verbs (as an index of seeing oneself as “doing” rather than “being”).

            <em>N</em> = 150) were ninth-grade students attending one of the lowest-performing high schools in California according to test scores. Seventy-three percent of students in the school were eligible for free or reduced-price lunch, an indicator of low socioeconomic status. Despite this, the school leadership was strong and progressive, and so perhaps there was untapped potential for student motivation and learning. To mirror the Study 2 sample, students in Algebra I were invited to participate and parental consent and assent were obtained from nearly all (95%).

A majority spoke Spanish in the home. As in Study 2, many students in the school experienced social adversities: 70% of students reported at least some form of physical, verbal, or social-relational aggression on a baseline survey in the first month of the school year. Some students could not be reached for the year-end survey, and so degrees of freedom varied across analyses.

First, many students’ English skills were poor, so we provided students the option of reading the intervention in Spanish (which had been translated by native Spanish speakers). Seven percent chose to do it in Spanish (this was no different by condition and did not have an effect on experimental outcomes). The intervention was delivered by computer rather than on paper (which was done in Study 2) so as to enable the option to complete the activity in Spanish or use web-based translation software. Next, the school was unable to provide an additional class session for the Cyberball experience of exclusion. Therefore, the measure of reactions to social adversity and the manipulation check survey items were administered immediately after the intervention, rather than 1–2 days later as in Study 2. Finally, all data collection (and the intervention) occurred in nonacademic classes such as physical education or art.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">As in Studies 1 and 2, some students (19) suspected that the peer Cyberball players were being controlled by the computer (as judged by reliable, independent coders blind to hypotheses or condition assignments; this did not differ by condition), and so their reactions to Cyberball were not analyzed (although their data for the remaining dependent variables were analyzed).</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Measures</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">All measures in Study 3 were identical in terms of both content and timing of assessment to those administered in Study 2, except for (a) the change noted above in the timing of the Cyberball experience and manipulation check, (b) the addition of a “warm-up” question that was useful for assessing self-construals, and (c) only end-of-semester grades were available for the two semesters and not the two additional intermediate grades per semester that were available in Study 2.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><em>Self-construals</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The first question on the September preintervention survey and May postintervention survey was this: “In general, what do people in your grade at school think about you? Type as many or as few words that people in general might think about you in the box below.” Ninety percent of students wrote a response, with an average number of 10 words. Responses to this question were first spell-checked to correct common errors and increase match rates for the LIWC software. The theoretically relevant linguistic category was 
              <em>common verbs</em> (e.g., 
              <em>walk, went, see</em>; not auxiliary verbs such as 
              <em>am, will, or have</em>). Examples of statements with common verbs were “I think outside the box” or “I know for a fact a few people do not like me, which honestly doesn’t bug me at all” or “I get my work done-most of the time” or “I try to be nice to people.” A dichotomous variable was created, such that participants received a value of 1 if they used any word in a category and 0 if they did not.

We believe this null finding is likely due to the difference in experimental procedure noted above (i.e., with the implicit theory measure coming right after the Cyberball experience), but we are unsure of the mechanism. Perhaps adolescents showed greater reactance because they had just viewed persuasive materials, or perhaps the Cyberball experience differentially changed the meaning of the scale choices.

Of course, the large majority of adolescents reported at least some peer victimization, and so perhaps all participants faced sufficient worries about being excluded by peers and therefore could benefit from the incremental theory. Overall, the effect of the incremental theory intervention on stress and health replicated even in a low-income, urban public school—a population thought to have many more environmental stressors and threats to health than the Study 2 population.

            <em>p</em> = .81 but did predict health (
            <em>r</em> = .21,

            <em>b</em> =

            Cooper &amp; Patall, 2009, for a review of raw data meta-analysis; also see 
            Schimmack, 2012). We then conducted moderated mediation tests (
            Imai, Keele, et al., 2010) to assess whether the indirect effects were significant overall and whether the indirect effects were significantly different across the two studies. In the stacked data set with Studies 2 and 3 combined, Cyberball exclusion significantly mediated treatment effects on long-term stress, –.02, 95% CI: –.03, –.01, corresponding to 8% of the direct effect—a small but statistically detectable amount. Cyberball reactions also significantly mediated treatment effects on long-term health (
            <em>b</em> = –.08, 95% CI: –.12, –.04), corresponding to 35% of the direct effect. Moderated mediation tests comparing Study 2 to Study 3 did not approach significance (
            <em>p</em> = .30 and 
            <em>p</em>= .76, respectively). Thus, when using all of the available data, Studies 2 and 3 support theory regarding the role of differential reactions to social exclusion as one mediator of long-term stress and health effects. This closely parallels the Study 1 correlational findings. For grades, the mediational findings across studies were more inconsistent.

A brief intervention teaching an incremental theory of personality reduced immediate negative reactions to social exclusion, and, 8 months postintervention, reduced overall life stress and reports of physical health problems. In addition, the intervention improved overall grades among those expected to benefit the most—students with an entity theory of personality at baseline. Furthermore, a textual analysis of students’ self-descriptions suggests the intervention may have seeped into students’ construals of themselves. If these linguistic analyses are confirmed in future studies, this may lead to new avenues for understanding the long-term maintenance of the treatment effect.</p><a id="psp-106-6-867-EADA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_148" title="General Discussion">General Discussion</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The present correlational and experimental studies support a novel social-cognitive account of what causes some people to adjust better than others during a developmental transition that is fraught with social adversities. Study 1 showed that adolescents just beginning high school reacted to social adversity more negatively when they interpreted it through the lens of an entity theory of personality, an implicit theory that leads students to see social adversity as stemming from traits that cannot change (
        Erdley et al., 1997; 
        Yeager et al., 2011). And perhaps because the stresses of social adversity accumulate over time, an entity theory predicted greater overall stress, poorer health, and worse grades at the end of the school year.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Given that an entity theory seems to be a psychological liability during the transition to high school, we sought to determine whether delivering a brief but theoretically informed intervention to reduce entity theories could promote adjustment. Studies 2 and 3 showed that exposing adolescents to an incremental theory of personality—the idea that people’s traits in high school are not fixed throughout life but have the potential to change—could alter responses to immediate social adversity and reduce reports of global stress and physical illness at the end of the school year. These findings replicated in a relatively advantaged high school sample and in a low-income, low-performing high school. Interestingly, the intervention had these lasting effects with no explicit reinforcement or mention of the incremental theory after the initial session.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The incremental theory intervention reported in Studies 2 and 3 also improved English, math, and science grades over the school year. In Study 2 this was true for all students. In Study 3 this was true for students who began the school year with more of an entity theory, a finding that is consistent with theoretical expectations. In each study, the intervention also affected more specific academic outcomes such as the pass rate in Algebra I, an important predictor of whether students will go on to graduate high school and attend college (
        Silver et al., 2008). The overall pattern of results suggests that implicit theories of personality can tap into a psychological hub during the transition to high school, resulting in effects that benefit multiple domains of development—even domains that, at first glance, seem remote to beliefs about personality traits.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The present findings add to past research in several ways. First, previous research has shown that implicit theories of 
        <em>intelligence</em> can affect academic performance (e.g., 
        Blackwell et al., 2007). But no research had shown that implicit theories of 
        <em>personality</em> relate to academic performance—either correlationally or experimentally. Next, previous interventions have taught an incremental theory of personality and affected social outcomes, such as real-world aggression in response to peer provocation (e.g., 
        Yeager, Trzesniewski, &amp; Dweck, 2013). However, the present research is among the first to show that an intervention addressing a belief about the social self could extend to the variables of stress, health, and academic performance during difficult adolescent transitions (also see 
        Walton &amp; Cohen, 2011).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Next, much research has documented an association between stress or health on the one hand and self-relevant cognitions and emotions such as self-blame or shame on the other (e.g., 
        Dickerson et al., 2011). Yet, no research had examined the link between stress or health and the underlying beliefs—in the present case, implicit theories—that have been shown to give rise to self-blame or shame (
        Erdley et al., 1997; 
        Yeager et al., 2011).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">More generally, a large number of past adolescent interventions have found it difficult to produce cross-domain effects on stress, health, and achievement, and this is often been interpreted as meaning that larger, more time-intensive, and earlier interventions are required (e.g., 
        Heckman &amp; Kautz, in press). Yet this interpretation perhaps undervalues the importance of psychological construals of adversity during difficult life transitions. The present research illustrates that a precise theory of the beliefs that give rise to problematic interpretations of difficulty can, during developmental periods rife with social hardship, have counterintuitively large and lasting effects across a number of domains of human functioning (see 
        G. L. Cohen &amp; Sherman, 2014).
      </p><a id="psp-106-6-867-ECADA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Understanding the Lasting Effects of Brief Interventions</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The present intervention used tactics developed in a long line of past brief social-psychological interventions that affected consequential outcomes over time (see 
          G. L. Cohen et al., 2009; 
          Pennebaker, 2004; 
          Ross &amp; Nisbett, 1991; 
          Sherman et al., 2013; see 
          Walton, in press; 
          Wilson, 2006; 
          Yeager &amp; Walton, 2011). 
          Wilson et al. (2002) showed that a brief attributional retraining intervention could improve struggling students’ grades at the end of the following semester, and 
          Walton and Cohen (2011) showed that a brief (1-hr) social belonging intervention could improve minority college students’ academic achievement 3.5 years postintervention (also see 
          G. L. Cohen et al., 2009; 
          Sherman et al., 2013). These studies have many elements in common with the present research. Each starts with a theory about how interpretations of a commonly recurring adversity—low grades, experiences of being left out or negatively stereotyped—could feed into a cycle of stress and academic performance. Next, these interventions seek to alter the meaning of these adversities—for instance, preventing the conclusion that struggling in school means you are “dumb” or “don’t belong,” or, in the present research, that being picked on means you are a “loser” and that the aggressors are “bullies.” Crucially, these interventions are delivered at times when adversities were predicted to recur, precisely when changes in the meaning of adversity can be critical for setting in motion the processes that sustain change and maximize its impact (
          Cook et al., 2012). Of course, an important future direction is to directly examine the optimal timing of the present intervention through further experimentation, in addition to broader efforts to develop theory and data about recursive processes that affect development (
          G. L. Cohen &amp; Sherman, 2014; 
          Yeager &amp; Walton, 2011).
        </p><a id="psp-106-6-867-EBADA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Strengths, Weaknesses, and Future Directions</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Several features of our studies lead to confidence in our conclusions. Studies 2 and 3 were conducted in two highly different school sites—one low-income and urban and one higher income and suburban—and we found evidence for the relation between implicit theories of personality and overall adjustment in both. This supports the generalizability of the direct effects, at least in these two different settings, acknowledging that it is unknown how similar these schools are to urban and suburban schools in general. Importantly, justification for causal inferences within these schools was clear. The experimental intervention was double-blind, meaning that teachers (and students) were unaware of assignment to groups and to hypotheses regarding stress, health or achievement, preventing them from treating experimental and control students differentially on the basis of condition assignments. Moreover, the implicit theories of personality intervention was compared to a control group that also learned a positive and optimistic message about growth, which controls for the simple placebo effect of getting an uplifting message. It therefore adds to previous implicit theories of personality studies that have not done this (such as 
          Yeager et al., 2011, 
          2013).
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Still, the present research is not without limitations. As with many findings in psychology, we do not fully understand the set of conditions required to obtain the effects documented here. While it is helpful that the findings replicated in very different school settings, it is also true that the research team held a number of procedural details relatively constant across the two experiments that may or may not have affected the results. This involves factors such as timing during the school year (the first few weeks; 
          Cook et al., 2012), keeping students blind to the persuasive purpose of the materials, piloting and customizing the intervention and assessments, and procedures to ensure students were minimally distracted when completing the materials. To the extent that future studies might alter these, effect sizes might differ. Effect sizes might also vary when contextual factors that produced the sustained treatment effect are not present (cf. 
          Lewin, 1952), as may be the case when conducting these interventions in new school settings. Altogether, the boundary conditions of the effects have not yet been mapped out and thoughtful replication efforts may help document these.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The present findings may also lead to future lines of research. First, the mechanisms that sustained the effect of the intervention until the end of the year could be further explored. One explanation is that the intervention produced lasting changes in adolescents’ interpretations of social adversity. Indeed, the exploratory linguistic analyses of self-construals presented in Study 3 provide evidence consistent with this possibility (also see analyses of lasting changes in interpretations of social adversity in Study 2 in the online supplement). A second explanation, however, is that the intervention’s effects on reactions to adversity might “wear off,” but only after they have set in motion positive recursive social and academic processes that reinforce themselves through their repetition (cf. 
          G. L. Cohen et al., 2009; 
          Finkel et al., in press; 
          Sherman et al., 2013). Perhaps treated students, by reacting with less stress, anxiety and negative self-feelings following early social exclusion, were more resilient when making friends, leading them to have more stable social networks. These social supports may have reduced stress levels and improved health and grades over time (see, e.g., 
          Walton, Logel, Peach, Spencer, &amp; Zanna, 2013; also see 
          Cacioppo &amp; Patrick, 2008). Future research with more diverse assessments from multiple informants could more fully track these potential processes.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">All participants in the experimental studies were exposed to Cyberball ostracism following the incremental theory intervention to test the hypothesis that responses to Cyberball would mediate long-term effects. However it is possible that exposure to this social adversity itself could have facilitated the longitudinal treatment effects by allowing students to “practice” their new, more hopeful way of thinking in the short term, before the incremental theory message faded. Indeed, past intervention studies testing the effects of values affirmation (
          Cook et al., 2012; 
          Sherman et al., 2013), attribution retraining (
          Wilson et al., 2002), and emotional reappraisal (
          Jamieson, Mendes, Blackstock, &amp; Schmader, 2010) have used an analogous procedure of having a challenge or adversity immediately follow the delivery of a brief psychological intervention. Like these past studies, we did not directly test whether this feature of our design facilitated the long-term treatment effects. Perhaps this was not necessary because high school could provide enough stressful experiences; the experience of Cyberball may be redundant with the real-world exclusion teenagers face. If so, then teens might have the opportunity to utilize their new implicit theory whether an immediate social adversity experience is provided by researchers or not.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Our research relied on self-reports to assess stress and health. It is reassuring that the relation between implicit theories, stress, and health both matched theoretical predictions and replicated across three different schools. Nevertheless, future research might supplement these self-reports by assessing the relation of implicit theories to biological indicators of stress following social adversity, such as levels of cortisol (see 
          Dickerson &amp; Zoccola, in press), as well as more objective and comprehensive measures of physical health.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Last, future research should assess the temporal relation between changes in stress and changes in achievement and health. We believe it is possible and even likely that the intervention, in softening interpretations of social exclusion, altered levels of overall stress, which in turn affected learning and academic performance. Indeed, in supplemental analyses not reported in the text, we found that the effect of implicit theories on grades over the year was significantly mediated by year-end levels of overall stress in all three studies. However, due to the timing of our assessments (stress was assessed in May, grades over the entire year), such mediational analyses cannot truly illuminate the direction of the relation between global life stress and either grades or health. An alternative possibility is that by affecting early levels of stress, the interventions improved grades and health, which in turn affected year-end levels of stress, in a recursive process that strengthened through its repetition (cf. 
          G. L. Cohen et al., 2009; 
          Cook et al., 2012; 
          Finkel et al., in press; 
          Sherman et al., 2013). Testifying to the interconnectedness of these outcomes, 
          Knack et al. (2011) showed that stress reactivity following peer victimization predicted later health problems, while 
          Nishina and Juvonen (2005) showed that the low grades and absenteeism among victimized teens could be explained in part by physical health complaints (see 
          Juvonen &amp; Graham, 2014). It will be interesting and important in future research to understand these possible reciprocal relations.

Our research shows that many teens are hearing this message loud and clear, and it is undermining their resilience.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Of course, not all people think this way. For instance, Winnie Holzman, the creator of the iconic show about high school, 
          <em>My So-Called Life</em> (
          Herskovitz, Zwick, &amp; Holzman, 2007), said (as summarized by 
          Senior, 2013):

          
<blockquote>“In high school we become pretty convinced that we know what reality is: We know who looks down on us, who is above us, exactly who our friends and our enemies are.” The truth of the matter, is that we really have no clue. “What seems like unshakable reality is basically just a story we learned to tell ourselves.” (p. 5)</blockquote></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Consistent with this notion, our research shows that adolescents can learn to tell themselves a different story, a story in which people have the potential to change. And when they do, they show better adjustment across the board: lower stress, better health, and higher grades. Going forward, it will be important for researchers, educators, parents, and media outlets to find ways to emphasize this message of the human potential for change.</p><a id="psp-106-6-867-R" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_169" title="Footnotes">Footnotes</a></span><a id="fn1" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><sup>1</sup> Greater detail on all procedures, measures, and results in the three studies can be found in the online supplemental materials.</p><a id="fn2" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><sup>2</sup> In this study and throughout the article, the stopping rule was to collect as much data as possible given the logistical constraints, student absences, and class sizes in each school.</p><a id="fn3" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><sup>3</sup> To further confirm that our Cyberball procedure had no lasting negative effect on stress, health, or achievement and that our extensive precautions were effective, in the present study, we were fortunate that other students in the same school were surveyed at the beginning and end of the year but did not play Cyberball.

          Imai, Keele, et al. (2010) program cannot test moderated multilevel mediation. Yet it seems likely that significant moderation by sample would occur given the robust mediation in Study 2 and the effect in the opposite direction in the present study, Study 3. At the same time, recall that the mediation effect for grades was only tested within the smaller subsample of roughly 45 students who began the year with more of an entity theory. And so statistical power to detect mediation for that outcome was dramatically reduced.
