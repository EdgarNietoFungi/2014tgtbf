The present research examined whether Black boys are given the protections of childhood equally to their peers. We tested 3 hypotheses: (a) that Black boys are seen as less “childlike” than their White peers, (b) that the characteristics associated with childhood will be applied less when thinking specifically about Black boys relative to White boys, and (c) that these trends would be exacerbated in contexts where Black males are dehumanized by associating them (implicitly) with apes (Goff, Eberhardt, Williams, &amp; Jackson, 2008). We expected, derivative of these 3 principal hypotheses, that individuals would perceive Black boys as being more responsible for their actions and as being more appropriate targets for police violence. We find support for these hypotheses across 4 studies using laboratory, field, and translational (mixed laboratory/field) methods. We find converging evidence that Black boys are seen as older and less innocent and that they prompt a less essential conception of childhood than do their White same-age peers. Further, our findings demonstrate that the Black/ape association predicted actual racial disparities in police violence toward children. These data represent the first attitude/behavior matching of its kind in a policing context. Taken together, this research suggests that dehumanization is a uniquely dangerous intergroup attitude, that intergroup perception of children is underexplored, and that both topics should be research priorities.

        Ariès, 1965; 
        Lampinen &amp; Sexton-Radek, 2010). It is troubling, therefore, to learn about contexts in which children experience harsh realities similar to those experienced by adults. In the U.S. criminal justice system, for example, thousands of children are sent to adult correctional facilities every year (
        Redding, 2010), and to chilling effect. Relative to peers sent to juvenile facilities, children who are sentenced as adults are twice as likely to be assaulted by a correctional officer, five times as likely to be sexually assaulted, and eight times as likely to commit suicide (
        Poe-Yamagata &amp; Jones, 2007; 
        Young &amp; Gainsborough, 2000). These outcomes are particularly worrisome for Black children, who are 18 times more likely than White children to be sentenced as adults and who represent 58% of children sentenced to adult facilities (
        Poe-Yamagata &amp; Jones, 2007). Given the near universal protection society attempts to afford children, why are Black children so vulnerable to being treated like adults?
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">When Black adults are treated more harshly than Whites, research often confirms that racial bias, explicit or implicit, is at least partially responsible (
        Dovidio, 2001). But racial prejudice has not previously been linked to treating individuals as if they are older than they are. In fact, racially disparate treatment of children has rarely been studied by social psychologists, and, when it has been, racial prejudice was not linked to estimations of maturity (
        Graham &amp; Lowery, 2004; 
        Rattan, Levine, Dweck &amp; Eberhardt, 2012). What, then, might be an alternate explanation for the treatment of Black children as adults? In previous research, 
        Harris and Fiske (2006) found evidence that members of dehumanized groups can receive fewer basic social considerations. As the perception of innocence is a central protection afforded to children (e.g., 
        Giroux, 2000; 
        Hendrick, 2003; 
        Kitzinger, 2003), it follows that this social consideration may not be given to the children of dehumanized groups, such as Black Americans (
        Goff, Thomas, &amp; Jackson, 2008), in equal measure as they are given to their peers. In the context of criminal justice, such dehumanization could explain some of the racial disparities in sentencing and even the disparate use of force by officers. This article, therefore, examines the possibility that the protections of childhood are diminished for Black children in contexts where they are dehumanized.
      </p><a id="psp-106-4-526-EKDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_9" title="Dehumanization Versus Prejudice">Dehumanization Versus Prejudice</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Previous research suggests that, in contexts where individuals are dehumanized (defined as the “denial of full humanness to others;” 
        Haslam, 2006, p. 252), social protections from violence can be removed or reduced—even when that dehumanization is not paired with explicit prejudice (
        Goff, Eberhardt, Williams, &amp; Jackson, 2008). Consequently, in this article, we explore the possibility that, if human childhood affords strong protections against harsh, adult-like treatment, then in contexts where children are dehumanized, those children can be treated with adult severity.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">This is consistent with previous formulations of dehumanization and infrahumanization, sometimes referred to as “a lesser form of dehumanization” (
        Castano &amp; Giner-Sorolla, 2006, p. 805). These formulations assert that traditional prejudice and dehumanization take distinct routes to discrimination and predict distinct outcomes (
        Eyssel &amp; Ribas, 2012; 
        Leyens et al., 2000, 
        2001). Several researchers have argued in particular that dehumanization is distinct from prejudice because prejudice is a broad intergroup attitude whereas dehumanization is the route to moral exclusion, the denial of basic human protections to a group or group member (
        Opotow, 1990; 
        Powell, 2012; 
        Staub, 1989).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">This conception of prejudice and dehumanization would predict that, whereas prejudice may prompt one to devalue a job candidate from a disliked group (e.g., 
        Dovidio &amp; Gaertner, 2000), prejudice would not predict endorsement of genocide or extreme violence toward that individual or group (
        Staub, 1989, 
        1990, 2000). Dehumanization, on the other hand, would. Consequently, although prejudice toward Black children might result in negative academic evaluations and social exclusion (
        Farkas, 2003; 
        Lareau &amp; Horvat, 1999; 
        Skiba, Trachok, Chung, Baker, &amp; Hughes, 2012), dehumanization of Black children might conflict with perceptions of children as needing protection. In other words, children may be afforded fewer basic protections in contexts where they are dehumanized, making them vulnerable to harsh treatment usually reserved for adults.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In this context, dehumanization serves to change the meaning of the category “children.” Individuals tend to understand “children” as an essential category (i.e., biologically innate, stable, discrete, and natural), the principal characteristics of which are age (i.e., young) and innocence (
        Giroux, 2000; 
        Haslam, Rothschild, &amp; Ernst, 2000; 
        Hendrick, 2003; 
        Kitzinger, 2003).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Because dehumanization involves the denial of full humanness to others (
        Haslam, 2006), one would expect a reduction of social considerations afforded to humans for those who are dehumanized. This reduction violates one defining characteristic of children—being innocent and thus needing protection—rendering the category “children” less essential and distinct from “adults.” This may also cause individuals to see Black children as more like adults or, more precisely, to see them as older than they are. As a result, dehumanization may reduce prohibitions against targeting children for harsh or adult treatment (
        Rattan et al., 2012). The present research tests the hypothesis that contexts where Black children are dehumanized reduce the human protections given to those children in two ways: making them seem older and decreasing the perception of “children” as essential—each rendering them less innocent and more vulnerable to harsh, adult-like treatment.
      </p><a id="psp-106-4-526-EJDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_16" title="A History of Dehumanization">A History of Dehumanization</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Historians of genocide often argue that dehumanization is a necessary precondition for culturally and/or state-sanctioned violence (
        Frederickson, 2002; 
        Jahoda, 1999; 
        Santa Ana, 2002)—a view echoed by some social psychological theorists (
        Opotow, 1990; 
        Staub, 1989). The logic of this assertion is that dehumanizing groups morally excludes them (
        Opotow, 1990), making it permissible to treat people in a way that would be morally objectionable if they were fully human. U.S. history is replete with examples of this kind of moral exclusion of Black children. For instance, the policies of chattel slavery (mostly pertaining to peoples of African descent) permitted children to be separated from their parents and forced into labor at any age (
        Guttman, 1976). In 1944, a Black 14-year-old, George Junius Stinney Jr., became the youngest person on record in the United States to be legally executed by the state (electrocuted without the benefit of a lawyer, witnesses, or a record of confession; 
        Jones, 2007). And, notoriously, in 1955, a 14-year-old Black boy named Emmett Till was dragged from his bed, disfigured, and lynched for allegedly whistling at a White woman (
        Crowe, 2003). What psychological context could explain this treatment of children? Again, there is reason to believe it may be contexts that provoke dehumanization.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">A growing literature demonstrates that individuals tend to associate out-groups and out-group members with nonhuman animals more than they do members of their in-group (
        Boccato, Capozza, Falvo, &amp; Durante, 2008; 
        Capozza, Boccato, Andrighetto, &amp; Falvo, 2009; 
        Haslam, 2006; 
        Loughnan &amp; Haslam, 2007; 
        Saminaden, Loughnan, &amp; Haslam, 2010). More to the point, research by Goff and colleagues supports the hypothesized link between dehumanization and sanctioned violence (
        Goff et al., 2008). In this research, White participants who were subliminally exposed to images of apes before watching a video of police beating a Black man were more likely to endorse that beating, despite the extremity of the violence. Participants did not, however, endorse the same beating when the suspect was White or when they had not been primed with the ape image. In a follow-up study, Goff et al. coded newspaper articles about death-eligible criminal cases in Philadelphia for ape-related metaphors. They found that the frequency of ape-related imagery predicted whether or not criminals were executed by the state. Of importance, in neither study was racial prejudice (explicit or implicit) a significant predictor. That is, dehumanization uniquely predicted violence and its endorsement.
      </p><a id="psp-106-4-526-EIDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_20" title="The Specific Historical Connection Between Blacks and Apes">The Specific Historical Connection Between Blacks and Apes</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Although a general association between a group and “animals” is one form of dehumanization, there are reasons to believe that some animals are more strongly associated with some groups than others. For instance, Jews were frequently represented as vermin (particularly rodents) during the Holocaust of World War II (
        Jahoda, 1999). Similarly, in the context of United States immigration, Latinos are frequently referred to with insect-related language, such as “hordes of immigrants” that “scurry over the border,” “infecting” U.S. culture (
        Santa Ana, 2002). Likewise, there is a long tradition of peoples of African descent being likened to nonhuman primates—what the philosopher 
        Lott (1999) referred to as the “Negro/Ape metaphor.”
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">This dehumanizing representation can still be found in depictions of soccer players of African descent, especially in Europe (
        Jones, 2002; 
        Thompson, 2013), and of the first Black president of the United States (
        Apel, 2009). Consequently, the research conducted by 
        Goff, Eberhardt, et al. (2008) tested the strength of an association between Blacks and great apes (e.g., gorillas, chimpanzees) in contrast to that between Blacks and big cats (e.g., lions, tigers, cheetahs). This research found that, though big cats were seen as more violent, more negative, and more strongly associated with Africa than were great apes, the Black/ape association predicted violence. This finding suggests that the strong historical association between Blacks and apes specifically—and not Blacks with simply any animal—may still influence the unique ways in which individuals dehumanize Blacks. Consequently, the present research uses the same methods as this previous work (
        Goff, Eberhardt, et al., 2008) to investigate the reduction in protections afforded to Black children when they are dehumanized.
      </p><a id="psp-106-4-526-EHDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_24" title="Dehumanization at the Margins: Adolescence and Felonies">Dehumanization at the Margins: Adolescence and Felonies</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The transition from childhood to adulthood is gradual, resulting in most societies seeing adolescence as an indeterminate mix of adult and childlike qualities (
        Burton, Obeidallah, &amp; Allison, 1996; 
        Johnson, Berg, &amp; Sirotzki, 2007). This ambiguity is even reflected in the views of the American Psychological Association (APA) on how children should be treated within the criminal justice system. For instance, in its amicus brief in 
        <em>Roper v. Simmons</em> (2005)
        , the APA argued in favor of abolishing the death penalty for children under 18, describing children as developmentally immature and less culpable for their actions. Conversely, in its amicus brief in 
        <em>Hodgson v. Minnesota</em> (1990)
        , the APA argued that children are mature enough to make the decision to have an abortion without parental consent. Most researchers have reconciled these viewpoints by postulating that children have developed the ability to make deliberate, unhurried decisions (such as medical decisions) but do not yet have fully developed the psychosocial skills needed for impulse control (key to avoiding criminal liability and violence; 
        Spear 2000; 
        Steinberg, 2008; 
        Steinberg, Cauffman, Woolard, Graham, &amp; Banich, 2009; 
        Steinberg &amp; Scott, 2003). Given the intermediate position of adolescence between childhood and adulthood and the prediction that the protections of childhood would be reduced for a particular group of children in contexts where that group is dehumanized, it follows that dehumanization would be particularly consequential for adolescents, as those protections may already be waning. Recent research by 
        Rattan et al. (2012) supports this conception of adolescence. In that research, participants perceived Black adolescent offenders as more deserving of adult treatment than an identical White adolescent offender, providing evidence for racial bias in the perceptions of juvenile offenders and for the labile nature of adolescence as a category.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Additionally, any context that provokes consideration of a child as an adult should be particularly susceptible to the effects of dehumanization. Within a juvenile justice context, then, felony cases may be particularly precarious because the serious nature of felonies allows prosecutors to raise the question of whether or not the suspect should be tried as an adult. Misdemeanors, on the other hand, do not. Consequently, a child felony suspect is most at risk of being misperceived as an adult because of her or his intermediate developmental stage and the severity of her or his offense. Therefore, we expected that perceptions of child felony suspects would be more affected by dehumanization than would perceptions of misdemeanor or younger suspects.</p><a id="psp-106-4-526-EGDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_28" title="Overview of Studies">Overview of Studies</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The present work tested the hypothesis that Black children enjoy fewer of the basic human protections afforded to their peers because the category “children” is seen to be a less essential category (specifically, less distinct from adults) when it is applied to Black children, particularly in contexts where Black children are dehumanized. We also expected that Black children would be seen as less innocent as well as older than their other-race peers. We expected that when children are seen as less distinct from adults, they would also receive fewer protections in both laboratory and field settings. Additionally, this could ultimately result in increased violence toward them relative to their peers in criminal justice contexts. Finally, we expected that the presence of dehumanization, and not traditional prejudice, would moderate each of these relationships. We expected in particular that the dehumanizing implicit association between Blacks and apes found in prior research (see 
        Goff et al., 2008) would predict reductions in seeing “children” as an essential category when applied to Blacks and, thus, also predict age overestimations of Black children and decreases in perceptions of Black children’s innocence.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Because several of our studies involved measuring perceptions in a criminal justice context and because boys are disproportionately represented in the juvenile justice system (71% of children arrested are boys 
        Snyder, 2005), we chose to focus on male Black children in the portions of the present research examining criminal contexts, using them as targets in Studies 2, 3a, and 3b. We designed Study 1 to test whether Black children are afforded the privilege of innocence less than children of other races. Studies 2, 3a, and 3b utilize undergraduate and police populations to test the hypothesis that the presence of anti-Black dehumanization facilitates the perception of Black male children as both older than their age and less innocent than their peers. Of importance, Studies 3a and 3b seek to demonstrate these relationships in the domain of encounters with police, with actual police use of force toward children being used as the dependent variable of interest to test our third hypothesis. Finally, Study 4 tests three of our predictions in a single study by examining whether, first, the category “children” is less essentialized for Black male children than for White male children; second, this difference is exacerbated when Black children are dehumanized; and, third, essentialism mediates the relationship between dehumanization and harmful perceptions of Black male children.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Support for these hypotheses would represent an extension of previous research on intergroup conflict by demonstrating that dehumanization not only reduces the inhibitions against out-group violence (
        Goff et al., 2008) but also decreases other basic human protections, specifically the affordance of innocence to children (in age, responsibility, and essence). This, in turn, would provide evidence for the conceptual distinction between prejudice and dehumanization. Although these predictions are a logical extension of previous theorizing, social psychological research has yet to examine the role dehumanization might play in the perceptions of children or to contrast that effect with the effects of traditional racial prejudice. Consequently, the present research represents the first attempt to establish a unique contribution of dehumanization to the perceptions and treatment of children. It also represents an expansion of the ways in which essentialism may influence intergroup interactions, as the consequences of essentialized notions of age across groups have not yet been studied. Finally, because the present research uses field data to test our hypotheses regarding violence toward Black male children, it represents a translation of theoretical work on dehumanization and essentialism into the worlds where they are most consequential.

From ages 0–9, children were seen as equally innocent regardless of race. However, perceptions of innocence began to diverge at age 10. At this point, participants began to think of Black children as significantly less innocent than other children at every age group, beginning at the age of 10. Interestingly, after the age of 10, the perceived innocence of Black children is equal to or less than the perceived innocence of non-Black children in the next oldest cohort. In other words, the perceived innocence of Black children age 10–13 was equivalent to that of non-Black children age 14–17, and the perceived innocence of Black children age 14–17 was equivalent to that of non-Black adults age 18–21. This provides preliminary evidence that Black children are more likely to be seen as similar to adults prematurely. What might be the consequences of this innocence gap in criminal justice contexts, where perceiving someone as not innocent has the most severe consequences?</p><a id="psp-106-4-526-EEDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_51" title="Study 2">Study 2</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In Study 2 participants were asked to make evaluations within a criminal justice context, examining whether perceptions of innocence differed by target race and the severity of crimes committed. Because we were interested in testing whether being perceived as less innocent was unique to Black children (as opposed to out-groups in general), participants also rated Latino children. Latinos, similar to Blacks, are stereotyped as criminal and violent (
        Levy, Stroessner, &amp; Dweck, 1998). If racial differences in the perceived innocence of children are due to stereotypical associations with crime or simply due to in-group bias, we should see similar perceptions of innocence for Black and Latino male children. However, if anti-Black dehumanization (i.e., a Black/ape association) facilitates racial differences in perceptions of innocence, we would expect Black male children to be uniquely perceived as less innocent.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In addition to determining whether Black children are perceived as less innocent than other children, we seek to test the hypothesis that contexts of Black dehumanization facilitate this racial disparity. Following evidence in Study 1 that the perceived innocence of Black children was similar to perceptions of older non-Blacks, Study 2 was also designed to test whether participants would overestimate the ages of Black children and whether dehumanization of Blacks predicts age overestimations. We expected, consistent with other investigations of severe intergroup conflict (
        Goff et al., 2008), that dehumanization would predict racial differences in age estimations but measures of racial prejudice would not. Consequently, Study 2 included measures of both explicit and implicit racial prejudice.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Finally, we predicted racial differences in perceived innocence and age accuracy would be especially pronounced when Black children were suspected of felonies (as opposed to misdemeanors), because felonies are the crimes that make children eligible for adult punishments in the justice system. As opposed to relatively benign misdemeanors that can more easily be rationalized as youthful indiscretions, felonies are more likely to motivate consideration of attributing adult culpability for one’s actions, as reflected by the availability of adult sentencing in the juvenile justice system.</p><a id="psp-106-4-526-ECEDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Fifty-nine students from a large public university participated in this study in exchange for course credit.

Participants saw each picture on a separate sheet of paper, and each picture was paired with the description of crime type (either a misdemeanor or a felony, described in greater detail below). Participants were asked to estimate the age of the child—ostensibly a criminal suspect—in each picture. The actual age of each target was subtracted from the participants’ age assessment. This score represented age overestimation. For each race of target, an average age overestimation score was created for misdemeanor suspects and felony suspects both within age ranges and overall.

              Olson &amp; Fazio, 2004), a modified version of the original IAT (
              Greenwald, McGhee, &amp; Schwartz, 1998). This task required participants to categorize stereotypically Black and White first names as Black or White and to categorize words that could be either positive or negative for a given respondent (i.e., 
              <em>peanuts</em>) as good or bad. The task is intended to measure whether participants are faster at categorization when Black names are paired with disliked items, as opposed to liked items, on the response instrument. Such response time disparities are interpreted as implicit negative attitudes. The names and words for the personalized IAT were taken from 
              Olson and Fazio (2004).

              Goff, Eberhardt, et al., 2008) is designed to capture a form of implicit bias against Blacks. The dehumanization IAT consists of Black/White, ape/great cat response key pairings. The choice of contrasting great cats with apes, again, reflects previous research that revealed great cats to be rated as more violent, more associated with Africa, and less liked by most individuals—minimizing the possibilities that a Black/ape association is due to associations between Blacks and violence, Africa, or general negativity (
              Goff et al., 2008). The human and animal names for the dehumanization IAT were taken from previous research (
              Goff, Eberhardt, et al., 2008).

Four scenarios were matched with pictures of young males from each age of childhood where significant differences in innocence were found in Study 1 (i.e., 10–17). Of the eight scenarios, four described misdemeanors and four described felonies.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The misdemeanor crimes included cruelty to animals, possession of drug paraphernalia, malicious destruction of property, shoplifting, possession of stolen property, and making unspecified threats. The felony crimes included arson, breaking and entering, aggravated assault, intent to distribute narcotics, rape, and armed carjacking. To maximize realism, we paired offenders with age-appropriate crimes, such that we did not have 10-year-olds accused of rape or armed carjacking. An example of a scenario where a Black male is suspected of a misdemeanor is “
            <em>Kishawn Thompkins was arrested and charged with cruelty to animals. He attempted to drown a neighborhood cat in his backyard.”</em> After seeing a picture of a target paired with one of the scenarios, participants completed age and culpability assessments for that target. After these assessments were made, participants completed the ATB Scale, the personalized IAT, and the dehumanization IAT (the order of IATs was randomized).

Of course, with small numbers of observations, it is important to be cautious in our interpretations of these correlational data. Because participants saw pictures from only one of each racial group, we could not test whether or not dehumanization predicted differences between Black, White, and Latino targets within a particular individual.

The magnitude of this overestimation also bears repeating.

The more participants implicitly associated Blacks and apes, the greater the age overestimation and perceived culpability of Black children. It is important to note that Latinos were rated neither as more culpable nor as older than Whites and that (not surprisingly) anti-Black dehumanization did not predict either measure of innocence for Latino targets. This suggests that our findings do not represent a general out-group perceptual phenomenon. Rather, the implicit dehumanization of Blacks appears to be related to unique effects on the perception of Black male children. To test the possibility that the dehumanization of Black children predicts worse outcomes in the criminal justice system, we next turned to police officers, a subject population directly responsible for criminal justice outcomes of children.</p><a id="psp-106-4-526-EDDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_94" title="Study 3a">Study 3a</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Does implicit dehumanization facilitate racial disparities in the perception of child suspects in real-world policing contexts, as it does in undergraduate populations? Previous research has argued that it is important to examine a population that has actual experience with child offenders when conducting research on criminal justice outcomes (i.e., 
        Steinberg &amp; Scott, 2003). Consequently, we administered measures of implicit dehumanization and racial prejudice to sworn police officers. We then compared these measures with career officer performance, exploring whether implicit dehumanization—and not racial bias—predicted racially disparate treatment of children outside of the laboratory. A replication of Study 2 within a police population, showing that the dehumanization of Black children predicts worse outcomes in the criminal justice system, would provide evidence that observed racial disparities in age overestimations and assessments of innocence are not simply due to inexperience with Black children, as might be the case in an undergraduate population. Independently, we sought to investigate our hypothesis that the presence of dehumanization would facilitate negative outcomes for children, as evidenced by age overestimations and racially disparate use of force against Black male children.

Severity levels range from verbal warnings (not included in the analysis), to a takedown/wrist lock, to kicking/punching with a closed fist, to striking with a blunt object, to the use of a police dog, to the use of restraints/hobbling the suspect, to use of a chemical agent (e.g., Mace), to use of a Taser, to use of deadly force (i.e., discharging a firearm or employing a carotid choke hold).

We calculated the difference between the age assessment and culpability scores for targets suspected of felonies and targets suspected of misdemeanors. We then entered these variables into separate regression analyses with mean-centered dehumanization scores and target race as predictors. The crime type × target race × dehumanization of Blacks interaction was not a statistically significant predictor of age assessments (β = .21,

Conversely, the crime type × target race × dehumanization of Blacks interaction was a statistically significant predictor of culpability assessments (β = .51,

In this study, participants, despite being better versed in dealing with criminal suspects, overestimated the age of Black and Latino child crime suspects. White children, on the other hand, were not subjected to such overestimations. Again, the magnitude of the Black felony age overestimation bears repeating, as Black 13-year-olds were miscategorized as adults by police officers (average age error = 4.59).</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Unlike Study 2, this study adds the ability to test within-subject racial differences. Whereas participants rated children of only one race in Study 2, here we were able to link our attitude measures to disparities in use of force toward citizens of different races. Consequently, Study 3a provides evidence that anti-Black dehumanization predicts racially disparate treatment of Black children in contexts where measures of racial bias do not. Rather, we have provided evidence that the representations of Blacks as less than human continue to cause contemporary harms in the lives of Black children.

It is important to highlight that these racial disparities were not predicted by traditional measures of explicit or implicit racial prejudice. Instead, these disparities may be a result of exposure to dehumanizing representations of Blacks. These findings are of particular interest because the subject population is one that is empowered to affect the lives of children. This finding is consistent with previous work documenting that Black children are disproportionately treated like adults in sentencing (
          Poe-Yamagata &amp; Jones, 2007; 
          Young &amp; Gainsborough, 2000). However, after Study 3a, we were cautious of overgeneralizing from a sample of 60 officers, only 28 of whom had used force against children. Study 3b, therefore, sought to replicate the field component of Study 3a with a larger sample.

Study 4 attempted to answer this question by asking participants to complete age and culpability assessments of Black and White male targets after being primed with dehumanizing words, which we hypothesized would decrease perceived essentialism of childhood. Participants were subliminally primed with either names of great apes or names of big cats. Previous research has found that priming with great apes (but not big cats) leads to the endorsement of police violence toward Black (but not White) criminal suspects (
        Goff, Eberhardt, et al., 2008). Perhaps the racial disparities we see in the treatment of children who are criminal suspects can be explained by the presence of such dehumanizing associations. Studies 2 and 3a provided evidence that age overestimations of Black child suspects occurred to the degree that Blacks were implicitly dehumanized. These studies also demonstrated that dehumanized Black child suspects were perceived to be more culpable (i.e., less innocent). Studies 3a and 3b provided evidence that implicit dehumanization predicts racially disparate perceptions of Black children in the world. Perhaps then, because negative perceptions of Black children were predicted by implicit dehumanization—and not bias—priming participants with these negative associations will lead to similarly negative perceptions. We suspected that dehumanizing associations between Blacks and apes predict reduced perceived essentialism of Black children. Implicit dehumanization was associated with racial differences in age assessments and culpability in Studies 2 and 3a, but we expected that essentialism would mediate the relationship between dehumanization and our principal dependent variables (age assessments and culpability). That is, we suspected that dehumanizing Blacks would cause Black children to be seen in less essentialized terms, which, in turn, would increase age overestimations of Black children. Study 4 was designed to test these hypotheses.

Participants respond on a 9-point Likert scale, with an answer of 1 indicating “strongly disagree” and an answer of 9 indicating “strongly agree.” See the

To conduct these tests, we used the SPSS macro designed by 
            Hayes (2012) for such bootstrapping analyses.

The direct effect of prime on age estimations was no longer significant after controlling for perceived essentialism (

Contexts where Blacks are implicitly dehumanized can facilitate perceivers thinking of Black children as a less essentialized group. This means that Black children are less likely to be afforded the full essence of childhood and its definitional protections. As a result, Black boys were more likely to be seen as older and more responsible for their actions relative to White boys. This study ties together findings from Studies 1–3 demonstrating that males of all races are not equally afforded the privilege of innocence—resulting in violent inequalities—and suggests that such racial inequalities in perceived innocence may be due to similar inequalities in the ways children of different racial groups are afforded the essence of childhood.</p><a id="psp-106-4-526-EADA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_200" title="General Discussion">General Discussion</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><blockquote>There can be no keener revelation of a society’s soul than the way in which it treats its children.—Nelson Mandela</blockquote></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Taken together, the studies presented provide a disturbing portrait of the effects of racism on Black children in the United States. Study 1 provides evidence that Black children are afforded the privilege of innocence to a lesser extent than children of other races. Studies 2–3 build on these findings by demonstrating that Black boys are seen as more culpable for their actions (i.e., less innocent) within a criminal justice context than are their peers of other races. In addition, Black boys are actually misperceived as older relative to peers of other races. Further, the above research provides evidence that, in undergraduate and police populations, these racial disparities are predicted by the implicit dehumanization of Blacks. These findings demonstrate that dehumanization of Blacks not only predicts racially disparate perceptions of Black boys but also predicts racially disparate police violence toward Black children in real-world settings.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Finally, Study 4 demonstrates that implicit dehumanization can facilitate these racial discrepancies. Participants who were primed with dehumanizing associations for Blacks showed a reduced belief in the essential distinction between Black children and Black adults. This loss of essentialism led to decreased perceptions of the innocence of Black boys. In policing contexts, this loss of protections may result in violent outcomes (Study 3a).</p><a id="psp-106-4-526-ECADA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Limitations</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Despite the consistent support of our hypotheses across four studies, these data are not without limitations. The present research focuses on the plight of Black boys, sidestepping the complications that might arise from a race/gender intersectional approach to this topic. Girls, particularly Black girls, represent a growing share of children in the criminal justice system (
          Guevara, Herz, &amp; Spohn, 2006). Consequently, it is important for future work to fill this gap.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In addition, despite the richness of the data sets utilized in Study 3a, the data linking anti-Black dehumanization to police violence toward Black children are predominantly correlational. It is reasonable to suspect that the inference we hypothesize (that racially disparate treatment occurs where dehumanization is present predicts) is reversed in police officers. That is, it is plausible that negative interactions with Black children disproportionately produce implicit anti-Black dehumanization. Though Study 3a provides experimental evidence that racial differences in age overestimation and culpability follow from the presence of dehumanizing stereotypes, this is merely suggestive of a causal direction with regard to dehumanization and actual violence. Future research should endeavor to clarify the relationship between dehumanization and racial disparities in police use of force.</p><a id="psp-106-4-526-EBADA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Conclusions</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The present research provides four important theoretical and practical contributions to the study of intergroup relations. First, Study 4 provides novel insights into the processes underlying the perceived essentialism of social groups. Previous research has demonstrated that global perceptions of the essentialism are malleable (
          Morton, Postmes, Haslam, &amp; Hornsey, 2009). However, we have demonstrated that the malleability of perceptions of essentialism is further nuanced. Specifically, we have provided evidence that perceptions of the essential nature of children can be moderated by race. For those who hold dehumanizing implicit associations between Blacks and apes—even when they do not endorse traditionally prejudiced attitudes—Black children are seen as a decreasingly essentialized group. For the same individuals, White children were seen as an increasingly essentialized group. Future essentialism research should attend to the implications of dehumanization on the essentialism of social groups. It stands to reason that one cannot possess essential human characteristics if one is not seen as fully human. It may be the case that other strongly essentialized identities, such as gender and sexual orientation (
          Haslam et al., 2000), are moderated by race and its potential dehumanizing associations.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Second, the present findings also advance previous research that suggests that racial and gender essentialism exacerbate intergroup biases and discrimination (
          Keller, 2005; 
          Morton et al., 2009Williams &amp; Eberhardt, 2008) but essentialism regarding sexual orientation attenuates it (
          Dar-Nimrod &amp; Heine, 2011; 
          Jayaratne et al., 2006). Researchers suggest this is because race and gender biases stem from conceptions of groups as distinct. Essentializing those group differences, then, magnifies the conflict. Anti-gay prejudice, on the other hand, often stems from moral disgust (
          Hebl, Foster, Mannix, &amp; Dovidio, 2002), an emotion that is often intensified by the notion that an individual chose his or sexual orientation. Essentializing sexual orientation reduces this notion of choice, thereby reducing anti-gay prejudice (
          Kahn &amp; Fingerhut, 2011). In the present findings, however, reducing essentialist perceptions of the category “children” imperils Black targets. This suggests that if individuals are members of “protected” categories (e.g., children, elderly, mentally challenged), essentializing those categories may serve a protective function in intergroup conflicts. Similarly, the reverse may be true for individuals who belong to reviled categories (e.g., child predators, drug addicts, and murderers). Future essentialism research may benefit from expanding attention to multiple categories in intergroup contexts.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Third, a novel implication of the dehumanizing representations of Blacks presented in this paper is that Black boys can be misperceived as older than they actually are and prematurely perceived as responsible for their actions during a developmental period where their peers receive the beneficial assumption of childlike innocence. This finding suggests that dehumanization may affect other-person perception functions in the service of permitting severe out-group derogation and antagonism. Importantly, though the data were inconsistent, it appears that anti-Black dehumanization may have a flip side—a kind of pro-White “humanization”—as the dehumanization IAT predicted decreased age estimations and culpability for White suspects. Given previous findings that dehumanization also seems implicated in racial disparities in death penalty outcomes (
          Goff et al., 2008), this provides evidence of an urgent need to explore further the consequences of intergroup dehumanization in the most consequential settings.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Finally, it is worth noting that the data reported in Studies 3a and 3b represent the first time that racial attitudes data have been used to predict racial disparities in policing on this scale. These findings, therefore, represent an important step toward understanding racial disparities in law enforcement—and in the world more generally—providing evidence that psychological explorations of police behavior on the streets can yield important insights in this arena.</p><a id="psp-106-4-526-EAADA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Closing Remarks</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Racially differential treatment of children is an important yet underexplored arena within social psychology. The present findings suggest how urgently field and laboratory work are needed to fill in this research gap. In addition, they suggest that if, as Alice Walker says, “The most important question in the world is, “Why is the child crying’?” then, for Black children, the most important answer may be that they cry because they are not allowed to be children at all.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Sociologist Michael 
          Kimmel (2008) has suggested that, for middle-class White males, the period of time when boys are not held fully responsible for their actions can extend well into their late 20s. In contrast, the present research suggests that Black children may be viewed as adults as soon as 13, with average age overestimations of Black children exceeding four and a half years in some cases (i.e., Studies 2 and 3a). In other words, our findings suggest that, although most children are allowed to be innocent until adulthood, Black children may be perceived as innocent only until deemed suspicious.

In addition, distance weapons (such as Tasers) are often deployed more readily than seemingly less severe tactics (i.e., wrist locks), due to the ability to deploy them without approaching a dangerous suspect. However, these rankings correspond roughly to several “use of force continuums” that other large urban departments use, and the training staff at the department from which data were collected affirmed that these weightings correspond to the “use of force levels of severity” that are taught at this department’s training academy and during continuing training.</p><a id="fn6" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><sup>6</sup> Computing difference scores regarding Latino children did not reveal racially disparate use of force toward Latino children.</p><a id="fn7" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><sup>7</sup> Previous research has found that age is an essentialized category, though to a lesser degree than other social identities such as gender, ethnicity, race, and disability (

Thus, we pretested the perceived essentialism of the categories young, old, children, and adults. We found that the categories children and adults were essentialized to a greater degree than the categories young and old.
