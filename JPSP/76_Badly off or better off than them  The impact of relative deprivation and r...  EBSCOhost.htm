Study 1 showed that compared to a control condition, relative deprivation and relative gratification enhanced implicit discrimination—measured through variations of linguistic abstraction in intergroup descriptions. Whereas both relative deprivation and relative gratification produced linguistic ingroup favoritism, linguistic productions of relatively deprived groups also conveyed outgroup derogation. Study 2 showed that relatively deprived and relatively gratified groups were overtly discriminatory in intergroup allocations of negative outcomes. The effects of relative deprivation were mediated by perceived intergroup rivalry and, in part, by perceived common fate. Perceived common fate partly accounted for the effects of relative gratification. Study 3 focused on mediators of relative gratification. First, members of relatively gratified (vs. control) groups worried about losing the ingroup advantage, which together worked as sequential mediators of discrimination. Second, relatively gratified groups reported higher existential guilt, which, in turn, was related to expectations of discrimination by the relatively deprived outgroup, and these sequentially mediated the effects of relative gratification. Overall, these studies highlight that both relative deprivation and relative gratification enhance intergroup discrimination and contribute to the understanding of the underlying processes.

        Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, 2011). Scientists, politicians, and lay people are still trying to understand this phenomenon and find reasonable means to deal with it. From a social-psychological point of view, such a situation is a breeding ground for feelings of relative deprivation (RD) and relative gratification (RG) by the groups involved. Indeed, relative deprivation arises when group members perceive a violation of their expectations on what should be granted to the ingroup, along with feelings of discontentment, dissatisfaction, and injustice (
        Runciman, 1966; 
        Smith, Cronin, &amp; Kessler, 2008). Expectations can originate from either the comparison with other groups’ achievements or the comparison between the present situation of the ingroup and its past or expected future situation (
        Davies, 1969; 
        Walker &amp; Pettigrew, 1984). Relative gratification—the opposite of relative deprivation—results from the awareness that the ingroup has a favorable position on some dimension of comparison (
        Grofman &amp; Muller, 1973; 
        Guimond &amp; Dambrun, 2002).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Research has pointed out that both relative deprivation and relative gratification represent antecedents of intergroup hostility (
        Dambrun, Guimond, &amp; Taylor, 2006; 
        Dambrun, Taylor, McDonald, Crush, &amp; Méot, 2006; 
        Guimond &amp; Dambrun, 2002). However, very few studies have experimentally tested the effects of RD and RG on intergroup discrimination, and the minimal conditions under which these phenomena can be observed are unknown. More importantly, previous research has almost exclusively focused on “distal” consequences of RD and RG such as ethnocentrism, generalized prejudice toward groups that are common targets of hostility within a given society, or support for anti-immigration policies (e.g., 
        Guimond &amp; Dambrun, 2002). Little research has considered that there are more “proximal” consequences of RD/RG experiences which involve the relatively advantaged/disadvantaged outgroup (e.g., 
        Grant &amp; Brown, 1995). To put it differently, would members of deprived groups discriminate against the outgroup that is apparently enjoying all the privileges they have been denied? Would advantaged group members refrain from showing bias against the disadvantaged ones, or would they discriminate as well? Moreover, to date little is known about the underlying mechanisms of RD and above all RG. Why would (dis)advantaged groups discriminate against outgroups? To what extent are perceived common fate and intergroup rivalry responsible for discrimination, and what role do intergroup emotions play?
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In this article, we address these issues by experimentally manipulating RD and RG under minimal conditions (
        Tajfel, Billig, Bundy, &amp; Flament, 1971). This was done in order to isolate the “pure” effects of relative deprivation and relative gratification vis-à-vis the outgroup—without possible confusion due to previous intergroup interactions and social status. The effects of RD/RG on attitudes toward the outgroup were examined both for implicit and more explicit forms of intergroup discrimination (
        Maass, Castelli, &amp; Arcuri, 2000). First, we examine how members of RD and RG groups use linguistic abstraction and valence of terms (
        Maass, 1999; 
        Rubini &amp; Semin, 1994) to express ingroup favoritism and outgroup derogation in a spontaneous and unintentional fashion (Study 1). Second, we examine whether RD and RG experiences are powerful enough to elicit explicit discrimination in behavioral decision. To clarify how RD and RG affect intergroup discrimination, we analyze the mediating role of perceived common fate and rivalry (Study 2), as well as the emotional reactions among members of RG groups (Study 3).

Indeed, it represents a powerful motive for social protest against the status quo (
        Grant, 2008; 
        Guimond &amp; Dubé-Simard, 1983; 
        Wright &amp; Tropp, 2002). However, even relative gratification can lead to collective actions aimed at protecting ingroup interests as long as advantaged group members see their privilege as legitimate and do not perceive violation to important moral convictions (
        Harth, Kessler, &amp; Leach, 2008; 
        van Zomeren, Postmes, Spears, &amp; Bettache, 2011).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Another crucial consequence of relative deprivation is intergroup hostility. A large corpus of research, mostly of a correlational nature, has demonstrated that the more individuals feel collectively deprived, the more they show prejudice against minority or stigmatized outgroups (
        Dambrun, Taylor, et al., 2006; 
        Vanneman &amp; Pettrigrew, 1972). Moreover, relative deprivation leads members to engage in intergroup competition to a considerable extent (
        Halevy, Chou, Cohen, &amp; Bornstein, 2010). Nevertheless, the few studies including relative gratification and relative deprivation in the same design have revealed that the relationship between deprivation/gratification and intergroup attitudes is not linear (a phenomenon named the “V-curve” effect; 
        Dambrun &amp; Taylor, 2013; 
        Dambrun, Taylor, et al., 2006; 
        Grofman &amp; Muller, 1973). For instance, 
        Guimond and Dambrun (2002), who manipulated RD and RG of psychology students by employing a combination of temporal and intergroup comparison, found that both RD and RG enhanced individuals’ level of prejudice against stigmatized groups compared to a control condition.

Studies on linguistic intergroup bias (for a review, see 
        Wigboldus &amp; Douglas, 2007) have shown that individuals vary systematically linguistic abstraction in communicating about ingroup and outgroup members (
        Maass, 1999; 
        Rubini &amp; Menegatti, 2008; 
        Semin &amp; Fiedler, 1988), with neither communicators nor recipients being aware of such a strategic use of language (
        Franco &amp; Maass, 1999; 
        Maass et al., 2000). In general terms, the linguistic intergroup bias reflects the tendency to describe ingroup desirable behaviors and outgroup undesirable behaviors in more abstract terms than ingroup undesirable and outgroup desirable behaviors. 
        Rubini, Moscatelli, and Palmonari (2007), for example, found that individuals described resource allocations performed by ingroup members with more abstract positive terms and more concrete negative terms than the same behaviors performed by outgroup members. This linguistic pattern implies the high generalizability of ingroup positive features and of outgroup negative features across different situations and time. Importantly, linguistic discrimination is sensitive to variations in socio-structural characteristics of groups and intergroup relations. For instance, groups having a superior/inferior position to the outgroup in terms of power or status use language in a more discriminatory fashion than equal power/equal status groups (
        Moscatelli, Albarello, &amp; Rubini, 2008; 
        Rubini, Moscatelli, Albarello, &amp; Palmonari, 2007).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">By varying abstractness and valence of linguistic terms, individuals can tailor biased intergroup representations that may result in ingroup favoritism or outgroup derogation. Namely, through language they can easily convey “ingroup love” but also “outgroup hate” (
        Brewer, 1999; 
        Moscatelli &amp; Rubini, 2011). As reported by 
        Moscatelli, Albarello, and Rubini (2008), groups of high and low status provided descriptions of ingroup members that were as favorable as those of equal status groups. However, high status groups described outgroup members with negative terms to a higher level of abstraction—thus revealing higher outgroup derogation—than the low status ones.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Overall, previous studies pointed out that asymmetries between groups enhance linguistic discrimination (
        Moscatelli, Albarello, &amp; Rubini, 2008; 
        Rubini, Moscatelli, Albarello, &amp; Palmonari, 2007). Although RD and RG have more to do with the material attainments of groups than with their status (
        Ellemers &amp; Barreto, 2001) or their degree of power (
        Jones, 1972), it follows that both relatively deprived (RD) and relatively gratified (RG) groups will show linguistic ingroup favoritism and/or linguistic outgroup derogation. This possibility was tested in Study 1.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Relative deprivation and relative gratification have pervasive consequences on individuals’ attitudes against minority groups (e.g., 
        Guimond &amp; Dambrun, 2002). Do RD and RG legitimate discrimination even when this implies explicit and highly counter-normative behaviors against the outgroup? As shown by studies on the positive-negative asymmetry effect (e.g., 
        Otten &amp; Mummendey, 2000), individuals usually refrain from being discriminatory when this means burdening outgroup members—for instance, by allocating them more negative outcomes. Whereas group members choose quite mindlessly to favor ingroup members over outgroup members in distributing positive resources, discrimination on negative outcome allocations occurs especially when categorization is “aggravated” by differences in group status, group size, or group power (
        Moscatelli &amp; Rubini, 2013; 
        Otten &amp; Mummendey, 2000; 
        Rubini, Moscatelli, Albarello, &amp; Palmonari, 2007). It follows that both relatively deprived and relatively gratified groups will show discrimination in negative outcome allocations. This possibility was tested in Study 2.
      </p><a id="psp-107-2-248-EFDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_18" title="Why Do Relative Deprivation and Relative Gratification Affect Intergroup Discrimination?">Why Do Relative Deprivation and Relative Gratification Affect Intergroup Discrimination?</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The few studies testing mediation of RD/RG effects have highlighted that different processes are involved. 
        Guimond and Dambrun (2002) found that cognitive processes (in their study, perceived intergroup improvement over time) accounted for the level of prejudice expressed by the relatively gratified groups, whereas negative emotions mediated the impact of relative deprivation. In a survey conducted in South Africa, 
        Dambrun, Taylor, et al. (2006) also showed that ethnic identification partially mediated the impact of RG—but not of RD—on prejudice.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In this work, we argued that the experiences of relative deprivation and relative gratification engender the perception of sharing a common fate with ingroup members (i.e., positive intragroup interdependence; e.g., 
        Cartwright &amp; Zander, 1968; 
        Lewin, 1948) and of high rivalry with the outgroup (i.e., negative intergroup interdependence; 
        Sherif, 1966). Common fate is a powerful antecedent of group entitativity (
        Campbell, 1958; 
        Lickel et al., 2000), and it is connected to intergroup bias (
        Insko, Wildschut, &amp; Cohen, 2013; 
        Moscatelli &amp; Rubini, 2011, 
        2013; 
        Rabbie &amp; Horwitz, 1969). Intergroup rivalry, too, is an important predictor of intergroup discrimination (e.g., 
        Esses, Jackson, &amp; Armstrong, 1998; 
        Sassenberg, Moskowitz, Jacoby, &amp; Hansen, 2007; 
        Sherif, 1966). Notably, 
        Rubini, Moscatelli, Albarello, and Palmonari (2007) demonstrated that power asymmetries between groups enhanced members’ perception of interdependence and this in turn accounted for the effects of power on intergroup discrimination. However, in that study no distinction was made between the intragroup (i.e., common fate) and the intergroup (i.e., rivalry) facet of interdependence.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Considering RD and RG experiences, it is likely that members will perceive that they are “in the same boat” of fellow ingroup members since they clearly share the same fate (being deprived or being rewarded because of their group membership). They should also be aware that their fate is interconnected with the fate of an outgroup with whom they somehow compete for resources. Following this reasoning, we can advance the general prediction that experiences of relative deprivation and relative gratification would enhance members’ perception of common fate and intergroup rivalry, which, in turn, should explain the impact of RD and RG on intergroup behavior. The role of common fate and perceived rivalry as mediators of RD/RG effects on discrimination was tested in Study 2.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Further insights into the understanding of the processes underlying RG come from theorization on group-based emotions (e.g., 
        Mackie, Devos, &amp; Smith, 2000). Both the experience of RG and that of RD trigger intense emotional reactions (e.g., 
        Leach, Snider, &amp; Iyer, 2002; 
        Smith et al., 2008). Whereas there is robust evidence that feelings of dissatisfaction, discontent, or anger elicited by RD are related to prejudice (
        De La Rey &amp; Raju, 1996; 
        Grant &amp; Brown, 1995; 
        Guimond &amp; Dambrun, 2002; 
        Guimond &amp; Dubé-Simard, 1983), less is known about the role of emotions in accounting for discrimination by RG groups (e.g., 
        Harth et al., 2008). According to 
        Leach et al. (2002), the awareness that one’s own group is privileged compared to an outgroup will engender different emotions depending on specific characteristics of intergroup inequality. When intergroup inequality is perceived as illegitimate and unstable—such as when RG arises from a violation of expectation in comparison with the RD outgroup—two emotional reactions are plausible: fear of losing the ingroup advantage, and existential guilt due to recognition that this advantage is based on the losses of the unfortunate outgroup. How do RG members deal with these unpleasant emotions? They probably start wondering about how other ingroup and outgroup members would behave. In Study 3, we examined the interplay between emotions and expectations about ingroup and outgroup behavior in accounting for discrimination by RG groups.
      </p><a id="psp-107-2-248-EEDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_24" title="Research Overview">Research Overview</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The first aim of the present studies was to examine the impact of relative deprivation and relative gratification—based on social comparison—in a controlled, minimal group-like setting. Unlike past research (e.g., 
        Guimond &amp; Dambrun, 2002), these studies considered discrimination against the outgroup involved in the comparison process. Furthermore, they focused on implicit and explicit forms of discrimination. Study 1 investigated whether RD and RG influence the two facets of linguistic bias, namely, ingroup favoritism and outgroup derogation. Study 2 focused on explicit discrimination by considering intergroup allocations of negative outcomes, and examined whether perceived common fate and intergroup rivalry accounted for RD/RG effects. Study 3 focused on RG and examined the role of specific emotional reactions, together with expectations about ingroup and outgroup allocation behavior, as possible mediators of the effects of RG on intergroup discrimination. We return to this after the first two studies have been reported.

Specifically, in the RG and RD conditions, ingroup members should be described with more positive abstract terms and more concrete negative terms than in control condition (
        <em>Hypothesis 1a</em>). Outgroup descriptions should be characterized by the opposite pattern (
        <em>Hypothesis 1b</em>). Considering 
        Halevy et al.’s (2010) claim that relative deprivation might push members to display aversive discrimination against the outgroup (rather than just ingroup bias), it is also possible that RD members would show linguistic outgroup derogation. If true, in the RD condition, descriptions of outgroup members should be characterized by negative terms at a higher level of abstraction, and positive terms at a lower level of abstraction, than descriptions of ingroup members (
        <em>Hypothesis 2</em>).

            <a id="b-fn1"> </a><sup /><em>M</em>age = 21.7 years) participated in this study on a voluntary basis. They were tested in groups of approximately 14 persons. The study manipulated the group condition (control, relative deprivation, relative gratification) and the group membership (ingroup, outgroup) of the person described (the “target”).
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The experimenter explained that the study was about problem solving and decision making, and announced that participants would be randomly divided in two groups of equal size (Alpha and Omega). Participants were distributed a booklet where they found their personal code and the group they had been assigned to. The experimenter announced that participants would start working individually on a problem solving task (i.e., recognition of the logical relation between couples of words). A grade would then be assigned to the performance of each group as a whole. To create expectations of proportionality between group performance and attainments, participants were told that they would be given a monetary reward proportional to the grade assigned to their group. Afterwards, a co-experimenter collected all booklets and allegedly started grading the problem solving task.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In the meantime, the experimenter explained that the study would take place in two sessions. In the current one, participants would work under “normal” conditions, whereas in a second session (scheduled for 2 weeks later), they would complete similar tasks while listening to an unpleasant noise (the sound of the dentist’s drill). Participants were asked to distribute seconds of noise to ingroup and outgroup members by means of an allocation matrix. The manipulation of RD/RG took place just before the allocation task. The co-experimenter announced she had just finished grading the problem solving task. In the control condition, she explained that the performance of the two groups was very similar (respectively, 62 out of 100 and 60 out of 100) and gave each participant a 6-euro coupon. In the other two conditions, the co-experimenter made clear that despite the very similar marks obtained by the groups, the research budget was unexpectedly insufficient to give them the same reward. Members of the group that had obtained 62 out of 100 were then given 6-euro coupons (RG), whereas members of the other group (obtaining 60 out of 100) were given 1-euro coupons (RD). Afterward, each participant filled out a single allocation matrix, which consisted of 13 boxes. Each box contained two numbers: one standing for the seconds of noise to be allocated to a member of the ingroup (top row) and the other for the outgroup (bottom row). The boxes on the two ends of the matrix represented the choices of parity (14/14) and maximum ingroup favoritism (2/26). Participants reported their identification code at the top of the page.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">At the end of the task, matrices were collected and placed on a table, where the co-experimenter was allegedly preparing new booklets by adding a matrix to each of them. Booklets were then distributed. Each participant was presented with a matrix allegedly completed by either an ingroup or an outgroup member, who had favored his/her group by circling the 2/26 box. On a separate page, participants were provided with five lines of space where they could explain the target’s allocation choice. Finally, they filled out the manipulation checks. A collective debriefing session took place at the end of all experimental sessions.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Dependent variables</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The main dependent variables were the positive and negative abstraction scores obtained by coding participants’ descriptions. Following 
            Semin and Fiedler’s (1988) linguistic category model, two independent coders blind to experimental conditions coded each sentence distinguishing between descriptive action verbs (DAVs; e.g., “He/she 
            <em>circled</em> the 2/26 choice”), interpretative action verbs (IAVs; e.g., “He/she 
            <em>favored</em> the member of his/her group”), state verbs (SVs; e.g., “He/she 
            <em>preferred</em> the member of his/her group”), and adjectives (ADJs; e.g., “He/she was 
            <em>unfair</em>”). The semantic valence of the predicates (positive vs. negative) was also coded. The inter-coder agreement was high as indicated by Cohen’s κ = .90 for predicate categorization and κ = .92 for predicate valence.
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Although the allocation task was just a means to obtain linguistic production, participants’ choices were scored 1 (
            <em>parity</em>) to 13 (
            <em>maximum ingroup favoritism</em>). To check for the effectiveness of the experimental manipulation, measures of cognitive and affective reactions were included (cf. 
            Guimond &amp; Dambrun, 2002). Participants rated whether the reward given to their group was lower/higher than expected on the basis of their group performance (expectation violation) and whether it was too low/too high in comparison with the reward given to the outgroup. They also reported how much they felt dissatisfied/satisfied (satisfaction) as well as gratified/frustrated and happy/unhappy because of the reward allocation (negative emotions; α = .81). In order to check for possible overlap between the RD/RG manipulation and group status, participants were also asked whether the performance of their group in the problem solving task had been worse/better than that of the outgroup. All measures had a 7-point scale.

Variations in this index provide a more immediate profile of the overall favorability/negativity of intergroup attitudes (cf.

These findings are in line with those on the V-curve effect (
          Dambrun, Guimond, &amp; Taylor, 2006; 
          Guimond &amp; Dambrun, 2002) as well as those on group power and group status (

          Rubini, Moscatelli, Albarello, &amp; Palmonari, 2007). Moreover, this study reveals that members of RD and RG groups expressed ingroup favoritism, with ingroup members being described with positive terms to a higher level of abstraction than outgroup members. RD groups also showed outgroup derogation by describing outgroup members with negative terms to a higher level of abstraction.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Findings on linguistic abstraction were paralleled by results on the proportions of positive and negative terms used in descriptions of ingroup and outgroup members. We advanced no hypotheses in this respect, since we were interested in the abstraction of terms as a crucial index of individual’s image of ingroup and outgroup. In this respect, a single negative adjective (the most abstract category in the linguistic category model; 
          Semin &amp; Fiedler, 1988) has a stronger impact than, for example, three negative descriptive action verbs (the most concrete category in the linguistic category model) in depicting a negative image of the target. Nevertheless, even when we considered the proportions of positive and negative terms rather than their abstraction, findings supported the prediction that RD and RG trigger more favorable attitudes toward the ingroup—and less favorable attitudes toward the outgroup—in comparison with the control condition. Since individuals can easily control the valence of the terms they use, we may conclude that our hypotheses were supported at the more implicit level of linguistic abstraction as well as at the more explicit level of the amount of positive and negative terms. The correlations between the abstraction scores and the proportions of positive and negative terms also supported this claim.

        Otten &amp; Mummendey, 2000). Second, this study aims to clarify the processes underlying RD/RG effects by analyzing the mediating role of perceived common fate with ingroup members and perceived intergroup rivalry. We hypothesized that in comparison with control groups, both RD and RG groups would show higher levels of discrimination by pursuing the strategies of maximum ingroup profit and maximum differentiation in favor of the ingroup to a higher existent (
        <em>Hypothesis 1a</em>) as well as by pursuing parity and maximum joint profit strategies to a lower extent (
        <em>Hypothesis 1b</em>). Considering the findings of Study 1, members of RD groups should show higher intergroup discrimination (
        <em>Hypothesis 2a</em>) and should employ cooperative strategies to a lower extent (
        <em>Hypothesis 2b</em>) than members of RG groups. Finally, we argued that members of RD/RG groups would report higher perceived common fate (
        <em>Hypothesis 3a</em>) and higher intergroup rivalry (
        <em>Hypothesis 3b</em>) than members of groups in the control condition. Perceived common fate (
        <em>Hypothesis 4a</em>) and intergroup rivalry (
        <em>Hypothesis 4b</em>) should mediate the effects of RD/RG on intergroup discrimination.

They were tested in groups of approximately 14 persons, randomly assigned to group conditions (control, relative gratification, relative deprivation).</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The manipulation of RG/RD and the cover story were identical to those of Study 1. Participants were provided with 12 allocation matrices in order to distribute time of unpleasant noise to ingroup and outgroup members. They listened to a sample of the noise and were shown a sample of matrix. Afterward, participants completed the allocation task and filled out a questionnaire with the measure of perceived common fate, intergroup rivalry, and the manipulation checks. Debriefing took place at the end of all experimental sessions.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Dependent variables</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Three matrices were used to measure the relative strength of the different allocation strategies. Each matrix consisted of 13 boxes, with each box containing two numbers. Numbers in each box represented the seconds of noise to be allocated to an ingroup and an outgroup member. By choosing one box, participants allocated the corresponding amounts of seconds to specific individuals (identified by numbers), one belonging to the ingroup, and one to the outgroup. By reversing the position of ingroup and outgroup, relevant strategies are pitted against each other or are presented as being together. For instance, for the matrix contrasting parity versus ingroup favoritism, the boxes at the two extremes are represented by the choices of 14/14 and 26/2. This kind of matrix produces two pull scores: one that indicates maximum ingroup favoritism (FAV) and the other that indicates maximum parity (P). When the ingroup member is on the bottom row and the outgroup member is on the top row, participants may choose between giving exactly the same amount to ingroup and outgroup members, or favoring the ingroup member by giving him/her less seconds of noise. When the position of ingroup and outgroup is reversed, the choices of parity and ingroup favoritism coincide at the extreme 14/14, since by circling 26/2 participants favor the outgroup over the ingroup. Comparing participants’ responses on matrices where two strategies are opposed with their responses on matrices where strategies are together, it is possible to calculate pull scores indicating the extent to which one strategy dominates over the other (for further methodological details on pull score calculation, see 
            Bourhis, Sachdev, &amp; Gagnon, 1994). Accordingly, in this study each matrix was presented once with an ingroup member and once with an outgroup member in the top row. Since all six matrices were presented with columns and rows reversed, each participant filled in 12 matrices, in randomized order.
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Six specific intergroup allocation strategies were analyzed. First, two strategies represented participants’ orientation to maximum ingroup profit: (a) ingroup favoritism at the expense of maximum joint profit (FAV on MJP) and (b) ingroup favoritism at the expense of parity (FAV on P). A further discriminatory strategy was examined: (c) maximum difference in favor of the ingroup at the expense of maximum ingroup profit and maximum joint profit (MD on MIP + MJP). The following cooperative strategies were also analyzed: (d) maximum joint profit at the expense of ingroup favoritism (MJP on FAV), (e) maximum ingroup profit and maximum joint profit at the expense of maximum difference between ingroup and outgroup (MIP + MJP on MD), and (f) parity at the expense of ingroup favoritism (P on FAV).

It also revealed that the effects of RD can in part be explained in terms of perceived common fate and rivalry. Indeed, RD experience led group members to feel that they shared a common fate, as well as to perceive high rivalry with the outgroup. Common fate accounted for intergroup discrimination albeit on the strategy of ingroup favoritism at the expense of parity. Intergroup rivalry turned out to be a more powerful mediator of RD, as it accounted for discrimination on all the discriminatory strategies, as well as for the lower adoption of parity-oriented choices. Conversely, little evidence was found with respect to mediators of RG. Perceived common fate partly explained discrimination by RG groups on the FAV on P strategy. However, RG groups did not differ from control groups on perceived intergroup rivalry, and rivalry did not work as a mediator of discrimination. Therefore, this study highlighted that RG enhances intergroup discrimination on negative outcome allocations, but it did not clarify why RG members actually discriminate.

Because in the present study RG was operationalized as violation of expectations in a social comparison framework, and this was due to the arbitrary decision of a third party (i.e., the experimenter), RG members are likely to perceive intergroup inequality as unstable and illegitimate. In these conditions, two group-based emotions appear to be pertinent (cf. 
        Leach et al., 2002). On the one hand, RG members will plausibly worry about losing their advantage and will want to maintain it; on the other hand, they are likely to feel guilty because of the unjust treatment of the RD outgroup. Since RG members are not responsible for the two groups’ condition, guilt was intended as existential guilt (
        Hoffman, 1976) and discomfort at the perspective of possible interactions with the outgroup. Although 
        Harth et al. (2008) found no relation between existential guilt and ingroup favoritism (see also 
        Leach, Iyer, &amp; Pedersen, 2006), in their study RG was based on rather stable intergroup inequality. However, existential guilt—as well as fear of losing the ingroup advantage—should play a role under illegitimate and unstable conditions.
        <a id="b-fn3"> </a><sup /></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Second, we reasoned that the two proposed emotions will lead RG members to wonder how other ingroup members would behave to ensure the ingroup advantaged position, as well as to think about RD members’ reactions to their disadvantage. As shown by several studies (
        Jetten, Spears, &amp; Manstead, 1996; 
        Rabbie, Schot, &amp; Visser, 1989; 
        Yamagishi, Jin, &amp; Kiyonari, 1999), members of minimal groups expect that ingroup members will favor the ingroup in resource allocations while outgroup members will favor the outgroup. Expectations of ingroup reciprocity and of discrimination by the outgroup are related to participants’ actual allocations (
        Gaertner &amp; Insko, 2000; 
        Moscatelli, Rubini, &amp; Albarello, 2008; 
        Stroebe, Lodewijkx, &amp; Spears, 2005). Accordingly, in this study we argued that the emotions raised by the RG experience will generate specific expectations about ingroup and outgroup behavior, which, in turn, will influence participants’ actual allocation behavior: Fear of losing the ingroup advantage will be likely to induce RG groups to wonder about how fellow group members will act to maintain ingroup advantage and, therefore, to expect ingroup reciprocity. Thus, RG members would discriminate as a means of “reciprocating” toward ingroup members in order to ensure the ingroup position. Conversely, feelings of existential guilt might lead them to focus on possible reactions by the RD outgroup and to think that outgroup members would discriminate out of their anger and sense of injustice. In turn, RG members might discriminate as a way of “compensating” for expected discrimination (cf. 
        Ng, 1981).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">To sum up, in this study we expected that in comparison with control groups, RG groups would report higher feelings of fear of losing ingroup advantage (
        <em>Hypothesis 1a</em>) and higher existential guilt (
        <em>Hypothesis 1b</em>). As in Study 2, RG groups should show higher intergroup discrimination (
        <em>Hypothesis 2a</em>) and lower use of cooperative strategies (
        <em>Hypothesis 2b</em>). They should also report higher expectations of ingroup reciprocity (
        <em>Hypothesis 3a</em>) and higher expectations of discrimination by the outgroup (
        <em>Hypothesis 3b</em>) in comparison with control groups. Finally, we advanced two hypotheses of sequential mediation. First, we expected that fear of losing ingroup advantage and expectations of ingroup reciprocity would sequentially mediate intergroup discrimination (
        <em>Hypothesis 4</em>). Second, we hypothesized a pattern of sequential mediation through guilt and expectations of discrimination by the outgroup (
        <em>Hypothesis 5</em>).

            <em>M</em>age = 19.93 years) participated in the study to fulfill a course requirement. They were tested in groups of approximately 12 persons, randomly assigned to group conditions (control, relative gratification).

In order to manipulate RG, participants were led to believe that two groups (Alpha vs. Omega) were present in the same experimental session. Whereas one group received 6-euro coupons as a reward for its problem-solving performance, the other group received 1-euro coupons notwithstanding the very similar performance of the two groups. Actually, because RD was not considered in this study, in experimental sessions where RG was manipulated, all participants belonged to the relatively gratified group and received 6-euro coupons. Control groups received 6-euro coupons. To avoid group manipulation involving scarcity, no justification was provided for the reward distribution. After RG manipulation, participants filled out a questionnaire with measures of emotional reactions. Afterward, they were asked to distribute time of unpleasant noise to ingroup and outgroup members by means of 12 allocation matrices. Finally, participants completed a questionnaire measuring expectations about ingroup and outgroup behavior, perception of intergroup inequality, and manipulation checks. Debriefing took place at the end of all experimental sessions.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Dependent variables</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Two items measured fear of losing ingroup advantage (“I fear that the experimenters will decide to take some money away from my group to give it to the other group”; “I worry that the other group may demand part the reward given to my group”; α = .83), and three items measured existential guilt (“I feel guilty toward the other group”; “I feel uncomfortable with the other group”; “I feel uneasy about the other group”; α = .60). Response scales ranged from 1 (
            <em>not at all</em>) to 7 (
            <em>very much</em>). As in Study 2, 12 matrices were used to measure the relative strength of three discriminatory strategies (FAV on MJP, MD on MIP + MJP, and FAV on P) and three cooperative strategies (MJP on FAV, MIP + MJP on MD, and P on FAV). The order of matrices was randomized for each participant. Mean pull scores could range from −12 to +12.

They also rated the extent to which they had control over the reward given to the two groups. Because the recognition of intergroup inequality is a pre-condition of the proposed emotions, participants were asked whether their group was advantaged over the outgroup and whether their group was superior to the outgroup (“We are better off than the other group”; “My group showed to be superior to the other group”; α = .83). All measures had a 7-point scale (1 = 
            <em>not at all</em>, 7 =

First, the results showed that RG members deal with their fear of losing their privilege by thinking that ingroup members, too, would favor the ingroup, and by reciprocating toward the ingroup. Second, RG members feel guilty and expect that the RD outgroup will behave in a discriminatory fashion. In the end, RG members seem to feel justified in their decision to favor the ingroup by thinking that they will be damaged by the outgroup’s allocations.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Sequential mediation effects were found on two discriminatory strategies, but not on the maximum differentiation (MD on MJP + MIP) strategy. Since this strategy is meant to measure the individual’s motivation to differentiate ingroup and outgroup outcomes rather than to achieve absolute ingroup profit (e.g., 
          Leonardelli &amp; Brewer, 2001), RG members might have not considered it an appropriate means to ensure the ingroup’s advantage and to balance expected discrimination by the outgroup. Finally, one may wonder why emotional reactions obtained low values, but this finding is not uncommon in research on intergroup emotion (e.g., 
          Harth et al., 2008; 
          Tam et al., 2007). Moreover, it seems hard to expect that members of artificial groups will react with strong feelings of fear and guilt as one could expect when considering real-world intergroup inequalities. In our view, what is notable is that despite the artificial intergroup setting, our manipulation of RG was able to significantly affect individuals’ emotional reactions.

Do relatively gratified groups discriminate against the unlucky ones? What are the underlying mechanisms? By addressing these issues, this research extends the literature on the consequences of relative deprivation and relative gratification in several important ways. In particular, it sheds lights on the experience of relative gratification by pointing out the role of emotional reactions and related cognition in accounting for intergroup discrimination.</p><a id="psp-107-2-248-EDADA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The Consequences of Relative Deprivation and Relative Gratification: Linguistic Discrimination and Negative Outcome Allocations</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The findings of Study 1 demonstrated that relatively deprived and relatively gratified groups communicate about each other by systematically varying the abstraction of predicates. By doing so, members of relatively deprived groups express their positive attitudes toward ingroup members, but they also tailor imagines of the relatively gratified outgroup that reflect outgroup hate. Communication provided by relatively gratified groups seem to be driven mainly by an ingroup-enhancing motive. Thus, while these findings are overall consistent with the contention that ingroup love has a primary role in intergroup relations (
          Allport, 1954; 
          Brewer, 1999), they also enhance the understanding of specific conditions that can strengthen the more destructive components of intergroup bias. Study 2 and Study 3 corroborate these findings by demonstrating that both RD and RG experiences legitimate aversive discrimination toward the outgroup. Thus, this research shows that the effects of RD and RG are detectable through an analysis of linguistic abstraction—which the individual is rarely aware of (
          Maass et al., 2000; 
          Menegatti &amp; Rubini, 2013; 
          Rubini &amp; Kruglanski, 1997; 
          Rubini &amp; Sigall, 2002)—as well as through the more deliberate form of discrimination of allocation decisions. Although these studies did not aim to examine how implicit and explicit measures relate to each other, the parallel findings observed on the two measures provide converging evidence on the power of RD and RG in enhancing intergroup discrimination.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The different nature of the two measures could however be responsible for some differences in these results. As discussed earlier, in Study 1, RD elicited stronger linguistic discrimination than did RG, whereas RD and RG groups showed similar levels of discrimination in outcome allocations. It is possible that RD groups felt higher hostility toward the lucky outgroup because of their strong discontent (e.g., 
          Smith et al., 2008). However, they might have tried to refrain from being too discriminatory because the outgroup was clearly no responsible for the two groups’ fates. If it were so, members of RD groups may have been more successful in controlling discrimination at the explicit level of intergroup allocation than at the linguistic level. Whereas this interpretation is speculative at this stage, these findings underline the importance of future studies to consider unintentional and explicit reactions to RD and RG experiences in the same design.

For RG groups, only common fate was partly related to intergroup discrimination. Thus, it seems that the intergroup comparison is more salient for the relatively deprived groups, possibly because they are victims of injustice compared the privileged outgroup (e.g., 
          Grant &amp; Brown, 1995). Conversely, RG members appear to be more focused on their luck and less interested in comparing their situation with that of the deprived outgroup.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The little evidence on RG’s mediators in Study 2 led us to direct our attention to different reactions brought about by intergroup inequality in members of privileged groups. Drawing from theorization on group-based emotions (e.g., 
          Leach et al., 2002), we focused on the emotions generated by an experience of RG based on the unexpected and illegitimate assignment of a reward to the detriment of the outgroup. Furthermore, we examined the interplay between emotions and cognitive expectations about ingroup and outgroup behavior in accounting for discrimination by RG groups. The findings of Study 3 showed that RG leads individuals to worry about losing their privilege, and to think that other ingroup members too will try to ensure the ingroup position. Hence, discrimination seems to be in part driven by RG members’ attempt to reciprocate ingroup favoritism and to protect the ingroup position (e.g., 
          Stroebe et al., 2005). The findings also reveal that at the same time, RG members feel guilty since they know that their advantage is based on the outgroup’s misfortune. They seem to compensate for the discomfort of existential guilt by reckoning that the outgroup would discriminate against them, so they end up by discriminating against the latter. In other words, discrimination against the outgroup represents a way by which RG members may actually defend the ingroup from expected negative treatment by the outgroup (e.g., 
          Ng, 1981).
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Overall, these results add to previous models on emotional experience of relatively advantaged groups (e.g., 
          Harth et al., 2008; 
          Leach et al., 2002) by emphasizing the role of fear of losing ingroup privilege and existential guilt. However, they go a step further by demonstrating that these emotional reactions are handled by group members through intergroup cognition, which, in turn, influences intergroup discrimination. Broadly speaking, this novel evidence brings converging support to the theoretical models that highlight the primary role of emotions in influencing cognition and behavior (e.g., 
          Frijda, Manstead, &amp; Bem, 2000; 
          Zajonc, 1980).
        </p><a id="psp-107-2-248-EBADA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Alternative Sources of Relative Gratification and Relative Deprivation</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In this research, RD and RG were operationalized in terms of violation of expectations made by a super-ordinate party within a direct intergroup comparison. However, one may think of other possible sources of RD/RG. For instance, there might be situations in which a group gains a favorable position by illegitimately overthrowing the outgroup and is therefore very much in control of ingroup and outgroup outcomes. In these conditions, emotions such as pride, gloating, or even disdain toward the disadvantaged outgroup are plausibly more relevant for RG groups than the ones considered in our study (
          Leach et al., 2002). On their part, members of the RD group are likely to be quite angry with the RG group—at least if they are aware of its illegitimate actions—and may therefore be highly discriminatory toward the privileged groups. A completely different case is that of groups who see their position as legitimate and stable (e.g., 
          Harth et al., 2008; 
          Leach et al., 2002; 
          Tajfel &amp; Turner, 1979). In this situation, members of a RD groups will plausibly be unlikely to protest against the status quo and may even show outgroup favoritism as predicted by system justification theory (
          Jost &amp; Banaji, 1994). For instance, this is the case of low-class individuals who do not strive against their socio-economical conditions and support political parties that actually defend dominant groups. Future research could therefore examine the reactions of RD and RG groups in conditions varying in legitimacy and stability of group conditions.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">A peculiar situation is that of groups who happen to acquire a privileged or disadvantaged position by mere chance. 
          Olson, Banaji, Dweck, and Spelke (2006) demonstrated that young children prefer children who are the beneficiaries of good luck (e.g., who happen to find some money on the sidewalk) over children who are victims of bad luck, and even generalize this preference toward the individuals who belong to the same group. Because in Olson et al.’s study respondents were not part of the lucky/unlucky groups, future studies should verify whether members of RD groups would refrain from discriminating against members of RG groups whose fortune is based on chance.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Finally, it would be interesting to examine the possible interplay between RD/RG—which derive from a violation of expectations with respect to the outcomes of the groups—and group status, which concerns group prestige or social standing. In our studies, the results on the manipulation checks made us confident that groups did not differ in perceived social standing. However, in social reality there are groups that enjoy a superior status position (for instance, graduate office workers) but at the same time experience relative deprivation when they compare their economic achievements with those of lower status outgroup (e.g., skilled workers). Conversely, one may think of RG groups who suffer from low prestige in a society (e.g., the so-called “nouveau riche” compared to the “patricians” or higher bourgeoisie). Future research could therefore systematically manipulate relative deprivation/gratification and social status as orthogonal factors within the same design.</p><a id="psp-107-2-248-EAADA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Conclusion</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In summary, the evidence we gathered shows that the unequivocal answer to our initial questions is affirmative. Both RD and RG groups do indeed discriminate unintentionally through communication and give more punishments to the outgroup when they have the opportunity. Individuals who are unjustly deprived of valued resources, but also those who are unjustly privileged over others, are likely to feel more entitled to show favorable treatment toward their own group and to behave in a hostile fashion toward the outgroup close to them. Being subjected to imbalance and unfairness in intergroup relations enhances RD members’ perception of rivalry with the outgroup, which, in turn, accounts for discrimination. However, discrimination by RG members can be better explained in terms of group-based emotions and cognitive expectations about ingroup and outgroup behavior. Besides contributing to the theoretical understanding of relative deprivation and relative gratification experiences, these results have important implications for real-life intergroup relations. Thinking of current worldwide crisis, this research suggests that intergroup discrimination consequent to experiences of intergroup inequality might represent an important by-product of the economic downturn. For their applied value, these implications should therefore be taken into consideration by even governments, politicians, business people, and bankers.</p><a id="psp-107-2-248-R" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_138" title="Footnotes">Footnotes</a></span><a id="fn1" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><sup>1</sup> Because preliminary analyses showed no difference between males and females on discrimination, gender was not further considered as an independent variable.

          <em>p</em> &lt; .002. It also differed from the RD condition as for P on FAV,

(2002) argued that the emotional reactions to relative gratification depend on four appraisal dimensions (perceived legitimacy and stability of advantage, perceived control of the means by which the RG groups have gained their position, and the degree to which the RG members focus on themselves or the disadvantaged). Because in our view individuals confronted with unexpected intergroup inequality (such as in our experiment) are likely to pay more immediate attention to their own situation, we were interested in self-focused emotions only. Because we had no predictions as to the extent of control over the distribution of rewards perceived by RG groups, we considered emotional reactions that can be experienced under either high or low control. Participants’ perception of control was, however, measured.
