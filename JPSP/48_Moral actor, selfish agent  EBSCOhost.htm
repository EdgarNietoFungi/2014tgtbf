This tension gives rise to 2 divergently motivated selves. The actor—the watched self—tends to be moral; the agent—the self as executor—tends to be selfish. Three studies present direct evidence of the actor’s and agent’s distinct motives. To recruit the self-as-actor, we asked people to rate the importance of various goals. To recruit the self-as-agent, we asked people to describe their goals verbally. In Study 1, actors claimed their goals were equally about helping the self and others (viz., moral); agents claimed their goals were primarily about helping the self (viz., selfish). This disparity was evident in both individualist and collectivist cultures, attesting to the universality of the selfish agent. Study 2 compared actors’ and agents’ motives to those of people role-playing highly prosocial or selfish exemplars. In content (Study 2a) and in the impressions they made on an outside observer (Study 2b), actors’ motives were similar to those of the prosocial role-players, whereas agents’ motives were similar to those of the selfish role-players. Study 3 accounted for the difference between the actor and agent: Participants claimed that their agent’s motives were the more realistic and that their actor’s motives were the more idealistic. The selfish agent/moral actor duality may account for why implicit and explicit measures of the same construct diverge, and why feeling watched brings out the better angels of human nature.

Perhaps seeing another person’s hardship draws feelings of empathy and genuine desires to relieve the difficulty. Alternatively—and more cynically—helping others may benefit the helper, particularly when other people are aware of the good deed. People value generosity in others. Thus, 
        <em>appearing</em> to be prosocial builds a positive reputation, which, in turn, confers social and material gains.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In Plato’s 
        <em>Republic</em>, Socrates debated Glaucon (Plato’s brother) on the underlying motivation behind prosociality and virtue. Glaucon posited that stripping away reputational forces—by wearing a ring that renders its bearer invisible—would turn a virtuous man into a scoundrel. With reference to this thought experiment, Glaucon defended the cynical proposal—that behind all virtuous behavior is the singular, self-interested motivation to 
        <em>appear</em> virtuous to others. In this article, we present evidence that humans have a dualistic motivational system that is consistent with Glaucon’s proposition. Specifically, people have (at least) two selves: an agent—the executor of action—and an actor—the watched self (
        McAdams, 2013). The actor tends to be moral; the agent tends to be unabashedly selfish.
      </p><a id="psp-106-5-790-ENDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_7" title="Prosociality and Selfishness as Two Adaptive Functions">Prosociality and Selfishness as Two Adaptive Functions</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Are people fundamentally selfish? To Freud, the selfish id was the mind’s dominant force. The more widely accepted Adlerian view is that self-interest and social-interest are each fundamental human motives (
        Haidt, 2007). People pursue both self-image and compassionate goals (
        Crocker, Olivier, &amp; Nuer, 2009), and have both egoistic and moralistic self-enhancing biases (
        Paulhus &amp; John, 1998). Selfish and prosocial goals serve their respective purposes, leading people to transition flexibly between the two. This turns social life into something like a theatrical play (
        Goffman, 1959). When people feel watched—on stage—they take on the role of the moral actor. Yet, when the curtain falls and the stage lights dim, the selfish agent takes over.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">From an evolutionary perspective, this “moral masquerade” (
        Batson, 2008) may solve an adaptive challenge. When resources are finite, a social problem emerges. On the one hand, behaving selfishly garners the maximum resources for an individual. On the other hand, behaving morally secures inclusion in groups, making generosity worth its costs (
        Millet &amp; DeWitte, 2007). Group membership is valuable to the individual because harmonious groups outcompete discordant groups and lone individuals for finite resources. Thus, both selfishness and generosity—or, to be precise, the 
        <em>appearance</em> of generosity—serve the individual’s interests (
        Haidt, 2012). By this reasoning, evolution may have selected for both selfish behavior (maximizing individual resources) and prosocial appearance (maximizing group inclusion).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Following 
        Haidt (2012), we define morality as an evolved mechanism that promotes and maintains the group’s wellbeing. Morality entails those “interlocking sets of values, practices, institutions, and evolved psychological mechanisms that work together to suppress or regulate selfishness and make social life possible” (
        Haidt, 2012, p. 70). We define 
        <em>moral motivation</em> in terms of the relative balance of self- and social-interest. A morally motivated person has prosocial motives that are of equal or greater concern to the individual as his/her self-interest. In this definition, moral motivation entails 
        <em>balancing</em> and 
        <em>coordinating</em> self-interest with the interests of others—not the 
        <em>subjugation</em> of self-interest (
        Frimer, Walker, Dunlop, Lee, &amp; Riches, 2011). 
        <em>Selfishness</em> is the dominance of self-interest over the interests of others. Immorality and selfishness are not the same insofar as selfishness does not necessarily imply harm to others, for example.
      </p><a id="psp-106-5-790-EMDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_12" title="Indirect Evidence of the Dualistic Motives">Indirect Evidence of the Dualistic Motives</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Past research inferred the nature of human motivation through behavioral observation. In the Dictator Game, one person is assigned to unilaterally divide a set amount of money between the self and another. When played anonymously, dictators typically favor the self in the distribution (
        Engel, 2011). Yet, subtly making people feel watched increases generosity (
        Shariff &amp; Norenzayan, 2007), perhaps by activating the moral actor. Rendering the game entirely anonymous decreases giving to virtually zero (
        Hoffman, McCabe, &amp; Smith, 1996), perhaps by de-activating the actor.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The selfish agent and moral actor can both attend the same situation, resulting in hypocrisy (
        Batson, Kobrynowicz, Dinnerstein, Kampf, &amp; Wilson, 1997). 
        Batson and colleagues (1997) asked participants to decide whether they or another person should receive a single valuable reward. Most individuals kept the reward for themselves. In a subsequent study, people had the option of using a moral procedure (e.g., flip a coin) to decide fairly. Most did. However, when the result was unfavorable to the self, most people ignored the coin toss and kept the reward anyway. One interpretation of this finding is that the moral procedure was the work of the actor, and the disingenuous task assignment the work of the agent. Consistent with this interpretation, situating people in front of a mirror for the task assignment eliminated the hypocrisy, perhaps because doing so recruited the actor to both tasks (
        Batson, Thompson, Seuferling, Whitney, &amp; Strongman, 1999).

Should the duality be evident in personality assessments? Some skeptics doubt the validity of accessing psychological functions through self-reports. 
        Nisbett and Wilson (1977) argued that people have little insight about the causes of their behavior: “Introspection cannot provide a direct pipeline to these mental processes” (
        Wilson &amp; Dunn, 2004, p. 493).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">While acknowledging the limitations of people’s insight into their own behavior, we suggest that their self-reports can still lend important insights into their mental processes. Individuals have a great deal of self-knowledge: No one has observed a person’s thoughts, behavior, and emotions more than the person him/herself. When it comes to summarizing a person’s own overall nature (as prosocial or selfish), we suggest that people are ready and able to report accurately. The challenge for researchers is to recruit the right self for the job. We suggest that the means of assessment profoundly influences the impression that emerges because it determines which self responds.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Past research has relied heavily on one form of assessment: self-reported, explicit ratings based on inventories. Completing an inventory asks the respondent to take an observer’s perspective upon the self (see 
        Table 1), effectively asking, “What do you look like to others?” Imagining watching a video of oneself driving a car, playing basketball, or speaking to a friend is an experience as the self-as-actor (
        McAdams, 2013). Rating the importance of various goals also recruits the self-as-actor. Motivated to maintain a moral reputation, the self-as-actor is infused with prosocial, culturally vetted scripts.

Open-ended verbal responses (e.g., narratives or implicit measures) require the respondent to produce ideas, recall details, reflect upon the significance of concrete events, imagine a future, and narrate a coherent story. In effect, prompts to narrate ask respondents, “What is it like to be you?” Imagining actually driving a car, playing basketball, or speaking to a friend is an experience as the self-as-agent (
        McAdams, 2013). Asking people to tell about their lives also recruits the self-as-agent. Motivated by survival, the self-as-agent is selfish in nature.
      </p><a id="psp-106-5-790-EKDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_22" title="The Dual Selves">The Dual Selves</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The 
        <em>agent–actor</em> distinction implies a dissociated self (
        Gebauer, Göritz, Hofmann, &amp; Sedikides, 2012). Inventories and narratives access different motivational systems (
        McClelland, 1980). For this reason, individual differences in the themes that emerge from implicit verbal responses only weakly predict individual differences in analogous scores on explicit, rated inventories. Furthermore, these two motivational systems govern different classes of social behavior (
        McClelland, Koestner, &amp; Weinberger, 1989). The selfish agent/moral actor duality may explain why implicit and explicit measures diverge—each measure recruits a different self, and each self has its own set of characteristic motives and functions. Taken together, this leads to the prediction that frames the current research: Inventory ratings, which recruit the self-as-actor, will yield moral impressions, whereas narrated descriptions, which recruit the self-as-agent, will yield the impression of selfishness.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The agent is the default self (
        Bargh, McKenna, &amp; Fitzsimons, 2002; 
        Higgins, 1987; 
        Schlegel, Hicks, Arndt, &amp; King, 2009; 
        Schlegel, Hicks, King, &amp; Arndt, 2011).
        <a id="b-fn1"> </a><sup /> In everyday life, people more often experience themselves as the executor of action (agent) than as someone being seen (actor). This difference in frequency of activation will lead people to experience the self-as-agent’s deeds as a more true or accurate representation of the self than the deeds of the self-as-actor. However, this perception does not imply that the agent is “truer” than the actor in any more general sense.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We see the agent and actor as equally important aspects of human functioning, each tasked with different adaptive functions. The actor internalizes and presents socially accepted norms about living in harmony with others. People will thus account for the moral self-attributions that the actor makes as ideals—as yet unrealized hopes. In sum, we propose that individuals see the selfish agent as the more real—and the moral actor as the more ideal—of the two selves.</p><a id="psp-106-5-790-EJDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_27" title="The Selfish Agent as a Cross-Cultural Universal">The Selfish Agent as a Cross-Cultural Universal</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We maintain that the agent’s selfishness is a universal feature of human nature, not merely an element of a particular time or culture. The individual self is motivationally more important than the collective/relational self to people of myriad cultures (
        Gaertner et al., 2012). Selfishness secures the required resources for individual survival, a task of critical importance to survival and reproduction. In comparison, prosocial behavior is of secondary importance to survival because it does not guarantee that the individual’s immediate survival needs are met.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The agent’s universal selfishness notwithstanding, culture may moderate the 
        <em>degree</em> to which the agent is selfish. Cultures differ systematically along an individualist–collectivist continuum (
        Markus &amp; Kitayama, 1991). In individualistic cultures (e.g., the United States, Canada, Western Europe), the primary consideration is the individual person. Individualists are motivated to achieve objectives as a means to an end of excelling beyond others. As the means and the ends of individualists’ goals both advance the self, we predict that individualists’ agents will be primarily selfish. In collectivist cultures (e.g., Japan, India, China), the primary consideration is the collective group. Collectivists also try to get ahead, but do so for the purposes of fitting in. Collectivists’ goals coordinate concerns for the self and others; compared to individualists, their agents come closer to balancing self- and social-interest (viz., are more moral). In summary, we posit that culture can tune up or tune down—but not turn off—the agent’s selfishness.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The agent–actor distinction may help explain why collectivists’ agents are less selfish than those of individualists. Collectivists more often attend to the perspectives of others than individualists do (
        Heine &amp; Buchtel, 2009). This enhanced attention to how one appears to others may activate the self-as-actor more often in collectivists, increasing the frequency with which they transition between actor and (default) agent. These transitions are psychologically uncomfortable if the agent and actor have different motives. Discrepancies between one’s own selves can produce feelings of disappointment or frustration (
        Higgins, 1987). To avoid this discomfort, collectivists’ agents and their actions may have equilibrated with their actors by becoming more prosocial.

Specifically, we predict that the actor, recruited by a self-report goal-rating inventory, is moral. Furthermore, we predict that the agent, recruited by a narrative goal description task, is selfish. In Study 1, participants rated and described their goals, then, for each measure, indicated the degree to which their goals help themselves and others. We predicted that participants would report that their rated goals are moral and their described goals are selfish; moreover, attesting to the cultural universality of this effect, we predicted that the same pattern would be evident in individualists and collectivists alike. Study 2 tested the generalizability of the moral actor and selfish agent by comparing actors’ and agents’ motives to those of people role-playing highly prosocial or selfish exemplars. We predicted that the goal content (Study 2a) and third party impressions (Study 2b) of actors would be motivationally similar to those of the prosocial role-players, whereas agents’ motives would be similar to those of the selfish role-players. Study 3 investigated the mechanism responsible for the divergent impressions.

After rating the importance of various goals (self-as-actor) or verbally describing their goals (self-as-agent), participants summarized the social nature of their goals. Actors claimed their motives were moral. Agents, by contrast, claimed to be selfish.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The agent’s task involved an explicit self-summary of its earlier implicit verbal response (i.e., goal descriptions). A benefit to this approach is that these self-summaries permitted direct comparisons between agents and actors. Did this benefit come at the expense of confusing the nature of the data (as explicit, implicit, or both)? We suggest that people’s self-summaries comprise a valid explicit summary of their implicit motives. Reports of implicit goal motives are based in the actual goal content: Prosocial word density predicted prosocial self-summary scores in both the collectivist and individualist samples, and it explained the self-summary differences between the cultures.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Aside from recruiting the agent or the actor, are the two tasks meaningfully different in some other way? Perhaps the rating task is abstract and the describing task concrete, leading respondents to construe their goals at different levels (e.g., 
          Liberman &amp; Trope, 1998). This construal level account does not seem likely insofar as the describing task not only included concrete/proximal prompts (“what” and “how” questions) but also abstract/distal (“why”) prompts, just as the rating task did. Moreover, in a follow-up study, we found no evidence that raters and describers were operating in different construal levels following the tasks. After completing the rating or describing task, a sample of 82 MTurkers completed the Global Concerns Measure, a validated measure of global versus concrete construal level (
          Fujita, Trope, Liberman, &amp; Levin-Sagi, 2006). Raters’ global thinking (
          <em>M</em> = 4.17, 
          <em>SD</em> = 2.13) did not differ from describers’ global thinking (
          <em>M</em> = 4.21, 
          <em>SD</em> = 2.01), 
          <em>t</em>(80) = 0.08, 
          <em>p</em> = .93, 
          <em>d</em> = 0.02.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The nature of the agent was selfish among individualists and collectivists, lending support for the universality of the divided self. We maintain that agent selfishness is a fundamental feature of human nature, one that culture can tune up or tune down, but not turn off. These results suggest that collectivists are more morally motivated than individualists vis-à-vis balancing self- and other-interest. That collectivists have a fuller moral toolkit resonates with findings from moral foundations theory (MFT; 
          Graham, Haidt, &amp; Nosek, 2009; 
          Graham et al., 2011); collectivists
          <a id="b-fn2"> </a><sup /> rely on moral foundations that individualists do not, giving them a strategic advantage (
          Haidt, 2012). However, this does not necessarily imply that collectivists grant consideration to both ingroup and outgroup members alike, or that they are more moral in other regards (e.g., in terms of principled reasoning, self-control, and empathy). Moreover, motivation to help others may often come at the expense of other virtues, such as personal accountability and individual initiative.

Yet, when these same people were in the mindset of the self-as-agent, they used prosocial words just as rarely as role-played selfish exemplars did. These results help explain why actors and agents offered such disparate self-summaries in Study 1. Prosocial concepts are less activated in the agent, relative to the actor. People readily self-attribute prosocial goals if explicitly prompted to do so (viz., asked to rate prosocial goals); yet, in the absence of an explicit prompt, people do not spontaneously produce prosocial words when describing their goals.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">To illustrate, consider some of the goals participants described. A typical goal description in the self condition was as follows:

          
<blockquote>My second goal is to decide what career I want, and go to graduate school in that field. To do this I need to evaluate my interests, and look for graduate programs that are right for me. This is important because I want to feel like I have meaningful and interesting work that fulfills me.</blockquote>
None of the words in this goal matched the items in the prosocial LIWC dictionary, and any prosocial theme is not made explicit. The tone of the self’s goal is about promoting self-interest, just as it is in the following selfish role-player’s goal:

          
<blockquote>To apply my talent and skills in a profession where my passion is most strong. Will have to work extremely hard and demonstrate to others my abilities to succeed. It is a life blood, a reason to live, as a matter of speaking.</blockquote>
The self and selfish goals are similarly devoid of prosocial words, unlike a typical goal of the prosocial role-player (10.3% prosocial words, italicized):

          
<blockquote>I want all children to have shelter from the elements. I need people to 
              <i>help</i> by 
              <i>donating</i> money, time, and resources to building shelters and 
              <i>helping</i> relocate children who need 
              <i>help</i>. Children are our future and they are mostly 
              <i>helpless</i>, especially the young ones. We need to 
              <i>help</i> them and 
              <i>care</i> for them. No child should be left outside in extreme weather—whether extreme heat or intense cold.
            </blockquote></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Study 2b compared third party impressions of the actor and agent and found that the self has uniquely inconsistent motives. A naïve coder reviewed and evaluated the prosociality of people from Study 2a, based on their goal ratings and, independently, from their goal descriptions. A second coder judged a randomly chosen selection of participants and formed highly similar impressions. According to the coder, subjects in Study 2a gave disparate impressions of themselves in response to the two measures. People in the self condition seemed far more prosocial (by approximately 2 
          <em>SD</em>s) when rating goals on a closed-ended scale than when spontaneously describing goals. This disparity was uniquely strong for the self, compared to the selfish and prosocial role-plays, suggesting that the disparity between ratings and descriptions is not merely attributable to a methodological artefact.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Is the self no different from the selfish exemplar? The equal paucity of prosocial words in the self and selfish exemplar conditions does not imply that the goals produced are equal in all ways. Indeed, an informal review of the goals gave the impression that the selfish role-players’ goals tended to connote elements of arrogance and aggression. These differences notwithstanding, the self and selfish role-players only rarely produced prosocial words in describing their goals. In contrast, the prosociality of goal ratings in the self condition more closely mapped on to levels of the prosocial role-players.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Agents and actors yielded pronounced differences between their self-perceptions (Study 1), in content (Study 2a), and in third party impressions (Study 2b). As agents, people exude selfishness. As actors, people exude morality. Participants rendered these divergent self-portrayals minutes apart, one after another. The tasks did not make explicit the meaning of their responses (Study 2a did not include the summary task). Had participants become explicitly aware of the self-discrepancy, they may have taken steps to reduce it. We tested this hypothesis directly in Study 3.</p><a id="psp-106-5-790-EDDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_114" title="Study 3: Mechanism">Study 3: Mechanism</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The purpose of Study 3 is to account for the differences between the actor and agent.

        Higgins, 1987). Insofar as the proposed mediator can be manipulated experimentally, we established mediation by experimentally determining a causal chain (
        Spencer, Zanna, &amp; Fong, 2005). Study 3a also tested whether idealistic and realistic
        <a id="b-fn5"> </a><sup /> mindsets alter the moral nature of the agent and actor, respectively. Study 3b provided a more controlled test of the latter causal link: that priming idealism makes described goals more prosocial.

For example, for participants who rated then described their goals, their rated goals belonged to the rated-unprimed condition, and their described goals belonged in the described-primed condition. Immediately after completing each goal task (viz., before completing the second task), participants were reminded of their goals (see Study 1) and completed the mediator measures (summary measures of how realistic and idealistic their goals are) and the dependent measures (how much their goals are about helping the self and others).</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><em>Mediator: Realism and idealism</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Participants indicated the perceived veracity of two statements, each on an independent slider scale anchored at 0 (

Because participants did not provide a self-representation (as in Study 3a) prior to completing the dependent measures, self-consistency drives cannot explain the prosocial shift resulting from the idealism manipulation. The results of Study 3b are considerably weaker than those of the analogous test in Study 3a (the interaction effect size was diminished by ∼70%). This may be because asking participants to become idealistic with a short set of instructions has a weaker effect than immersion in one’s own personal idealism. Nonetheless, in concert with Study 3a, the results suggest that the realism–idealism distinction does help explain why the agent is selfish and the actor moral.</p><a id="psp-106-5-790-EADA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_162" title="General Discussion">General Discussion</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The motivation to behave selfishly while appearing moral gave rise to two, divergently motivated selves. The actor—the watched self—tends to be moral; the agent—the self as executor—tends to be selfish. Each self serves its own adaptive function: The actor helps people maintain inclusion in groups, whereas the agent attends to basic survival needs. Three studies support the thesis that the actor is moral and the agent is selfish. In Study 1, actors claimed their goals were equally about helping the self and others (viz., moral); agents claimed their goals were primarily about helping the self (viz., selfish). This disparity was evident in both individualist and collectivist cultures, albeit more so among individualists. Study 2 compared actors and agents’ motives to those of people role-playing highly prosocial or selfish exemplars. In content and in the impression they made upon an outside observer, actors’ motives were similar to those of the prosocial role-players, whereas agents’ motives were similar to those of the selfish role-players. In Study 3, participants claimed that their agent’s motives were the more realistic and their actor’s motives the more idealistic of the two. When asked to take on an idealistic mindset, agents became more moral; a realistic mindset made the actor more selfish.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Is the agent’s selfishness a universal feature of human nature, sourced to evolutionary selection processes (
        Dawkins, 2006) or a cultural artifact (
        Miller, 1999)? The results from Study 1 suggest that both may be the case: The agent’s selfishness is evident in both individualist and collectivist cultures, suggesting that the selfish agent is a human universal. However, the agent’s selfishness was more pronounced in individualists. We suggest that the smaller disparity between the selves of collectivists is due to their tendency to attend to others’ perspectives (
        Heine &amp; Buchtel, 2009). Collectivists more often recall memories of themselves from a third-person perspective than do individualists (
        Cohen &amp; Gunz, 2002), and they outperform individualists on visual perspective-taking tasks (
        Wu &amp; Keysar, 2007). This perspective taking activates the (moral) self-as-actor. Increasingly aware of the disparity between the motives of their agents and actors, collectivists experience more discomfort. To reduce this discomfort, collectivists’ agents may have become more prosocially motivated.

Support for the second link—that idealism/realism influences the moral quality of the selves—was less conclusive. Specifically, the evidence was prone to alternative explanations (e.g., self-discrepancy in Study 3a) or simply weak (in Study 3b). Interpreted together, however, we suggest that the evidence is generally supportive of the proposed model.</p><a id="psp-106-5-790-EBADA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Future Directions</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">When people feel observed by others, moral behavior follows: People are increasingly likely to honor their commitments (
          Batson et al., 1997) and behave generously (
          Shariff &amp; Norenzayan, 2007). These prosocial acts could be purely strategic. Watched people may behave morally to avoid the negative repercussions associated with misbehavior and getting caught red-handed. The present research raises the possibility of a “deeper” mechanism—feeling watched de-activates the self-as-agent and/or activates the self-as-actor. Alternatively, feeling watched could raise the moral quality of the agent. Future research should investigate whether feeling watched recruits the self-as-actor and/or makes the self-as-agent more prosocial.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">This article presented evidence of the different moral natures of the agent and actor, and accounted for the difference as perceived realism and idealism, respectively. Additional factors may also differentiate the two selves (e.g., recognition vs. recall; semantic memory vs. episodic memory; intuitive vs. deliberative processing). Future research should further examine other differences between the two selves.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The present research focused solely on differences between the selves without attending to behavioral consequences. For example, do people who have relatively prosocial agents also choose helping careers, volunteer, and give to charity? Future research should investigate whether individual differences in the prosociality of described goals (and other verbal responses) predict prosocial behaviors.</p><a id="psp-106-5-790-EAADA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Conclusion</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">When in the executor self-as-agent mindset, people claim to be selfish and experience this nature as reflective of reality. When viewing themselves from an outsider’s perspective (the self-as-actor), people claim to be moral and experience this nature as reflective of their ideals. Are they correct? Is the selfish agent the “true” self and the moral actor a “false” self? We suggest not. Rather than thinking about selves as true or false, we prefer to think about their social functions. Following others (e.g., 
          Haidt, 2012; 
          McAdams, 2013), we suggest that the actor and the agent each perform adaptive personal and social functions. The selfish agent is for survival. The moral actor is for fitting in and making social life possible. When public goods are on the line, the task for civil society is to recruit moral actors.
