Does metaphor use have consequences for people’s motivation to engage in goal-directed action? Three experiments examine the effect of metaphor use on students’ engagement with their academic possible identity: their image of themselves as academically successful graduates. Students primed to frame their academic possible identity using the goal-as-journey metaphor reported stronger academic intention, and displayed increased effort on academic tasks, compared to students primed with a nonacademic possible identity, a different metaphoric framing (goal-as-contained-entity), and past academic achievements (Studies 1–2). This motivating effect persisted up to a week later as reflected in final exam performance (Study 3). Four experiments examine the cognitive processes underlying this effect. Conceptual metaphor theory posits that an accessible metaphor transfers knowledge between dissimilar concepts. As predicted in this paradigm, a journey-metaphoric framing of a possible academic identity transferred confidence in the procedure, or action sequence, required to attain that possible identity, which in turn led participants to perceive that possible identity as more connected to their current identity (Study 4). Drawing on identity-based motivation theory, we hypothesized that strengthened current/possible identity connection would mediate the journey framing’s motivating effect. This mediational process predicted students’ academic engagement (Study 5) and an online sample’s engagement with possible identities in other domains (Study 6). Also as predicted, journey framing increased academic engagement particularly among students reporting a weak connection to their academic possible identity (Study 7).

Smith).</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">College orientation materials commonly describe an undergraduate career metaphorically as if it were a physical journey. Duke University, for example, tells students, “You are about to begin the journey of undergraduate education”; Carnegie Mellon University reminds students that “ahead of you lay unlimited possibilities”; and the University of Hawai‘i offers suggestions for “what happens if you hit a road block.” Of course, college is not literally a journey, and academic activities such as studying are superficially quite unlike the experiences of moving forward on a physical path, choosing a direction, and navigating difficult terrain. Why is the journey metaphor used so widely to inspire students to care about and invest effort into academic activities?</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">One possibility is that such communications tap into metaphor’s undiscovered potential to spur action. Encouraging students to imagine themselves as academically accomplished graduates can be insufficient to boost academic engagement, and it may be uniquely motivating to frame that “accomplished graduate” possible identity metaphorically as a destination on a journey that they actively take. The journey metaphor cues a sense that one knows how to reach a goal and fosters identity connection. In this article we propose that these elements are essential to understanding how the journey metaphor uniquely influences students’ understanding of their academic future and hence their motivation to achieve academic goals.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In the current studies we integrate conceptual metaphor theory (
        Lakoff &amp; Johnson, 1980) and identity-based motivation theory (
        Oyserman, 2007, 
        2013) to test these propositions. We do so in two parts. First, we test whether priming a journey-metaphoric framing of an academic possible identity increases academic engagement, operationalized as academic intention and effort, and whether this effect persists over time (Studies 1–3).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Second, we unpack the cognitive processes mediating this effect. While not all journeys follow a linear, predetermined route, people generally know that on a journey there is a clear procedure for how to reach the destination: One must take action now to progress; steps are actively taken in a sequence designated by the path; and each step clarifies what needs to be done next. Consequently, current action feels relevant to reaching the destination. When people use the journey metaphor to frame a goal, they transfer this procedural confidence to their understanding of goal attainment. This strengthens their perception that a goal is connected to their current identity through a coherent sequence of actions that begins in the present. To test this process model (elaborated later), we ask three questions: Does priming a journey-metaphoric framing strengthen perceived connection to a possible identity by means of buttressing procedural confidence about that identity (Study 4)? Does a journey-metaphoric framing increase engagement with a possible identity by means of increasing identity connection (Studies 5 and 6)? Is a journey framing beneficial particularly for individuals who perceive a weak connection to their possible identity (Study 7)?</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Beyond the theoretical innovation of modeling metaphoric influences on motivation, understanding how metaphor use can enhance goal engagement is of practical importance. In the academic domain, it is clear that students commonly plan to succeed, yet they often fail to prioritize and invest sufficient effort into their current academic activities. Using the journey metaphor can be a way forward if the right conditions are in place.</p><a id="psp-106-5-679-EHDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_10" title="The Problem: Low Academic Engagement">The Problem: Low Academic Engagement</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Most American high school students, regardless of their race–ethnicity or socioeconomic background, plan to earn at least a bachelor’s degree (nearly 85% of U.S. 10th graders; 
        Domina, Conley, &amp; Farkas, 2011). A third of students starting college plan to major in science, technology, engineering, or math-related fields (STEM). However, academic attainment does not always meet these high expectations (e.g., 
        Maltese &amp; Tai, 2011). Only about half of students who enroll in four-year colleges finish within 6 years (
        Symonds, Schwartz, &amp; Ferguson, 2011). Moreover, even students who graduate often do so after shifting out of demanding majors due to their poor test performance (e.g., 
        Rask, 2010). Qualified students switch out of STEM majors when they encounter what has been described as “the math–science death march” in which they are made to compete with hundreds of other students in large lecture hall classes with high demands and lower grades relative to other majors (
        Drew, 2011).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In these settings, student attainments may fall short of aspirations because courses are set up to “weed out” students, with grading designed to reduce the number of students eligible for the next level of required coursework. Additionally, the content of academic tests widely used for such weeding out is often loaded with cultural knowledge that is irrelevant to the knowledge or skill being assessed, causing performance disparities between groups of students with dissimilar cultural backgrounds (
        Hamdi, Knirk, &amp; Michael, 1982; 
        Reynolds, 1982). Further, students may be unable to compete because they have not received appropriate prior preparation or because they are stereotyped as unable to do so (
        Croizet, 2008; 
        Entwisle, Alexander, &amp; Olson, 2005; 
        Jackson, 2010; 
        Orfield, Losen, Wald, &amp; Swanson, 2004; 
        Steele, Spencer, &amp; Aronson, 2002). Salient stereotypes can undermine performance when they lead students to interpret difficulties to mean that the task is impossible (
        Smith, Novin, Elmore, &amp; Oyserman, 2014), that they simply do not have the ability (
        Aronson, Fried, &amp; Good, 2002), or that they do not “fit in” at college generally (
        Walton &amp; Cohen, 2007).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">While these psychological and structural barriers to success are important for explaining underperformance among students targeted by stereotypes and disadvantaged by social-structural conditions, students who do not experience these impediments also underperform compared to their aspirations. This is partly due to a mismatch between students’ academic engagement—the degree to which they intend to prioritize and put their best effort into academic activities—and how much engagement is necessary to succeed. As a result, college students often fail to take advantage of tutoring and other academic resources (
        Hu &amp; Kuh, 2002), fail to prioritize academic goals over other goals (
        Arum, Roksa, &amp; Cho, 2011), and devote too little time and energy to attending class, studying, and doing coursework (
        Bishop, 2001).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Although correlated with social-structural factors (e.g., 
        Stout &amp; Christenson, 2009), this engagement gap undermines academic success across social groups. For example, while student background characteristics (e.g., race, gender, and socioeconomic status) explain 7% of freshman-year failure rates, course absences and time devoted to studying explain an additional 61% (
        Allensworth &amp; Easton, 2007). Students may miss class and study too little because they fail to notice that they need to take immediate and sustained action to succeed. Perhaps for this reason, interventions meant to increase the salience of academic goals and their fit with one’s current identity significantly improve academic performance (e.g., 
        Oyserman, Bybee, &amp; Terry, 2006).
      </p><a id="psp-106-5-679-EGDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_16" title="A Solution: Increasing Academic Engagement by Activating a Connected Possible Identity">A Solution: Increasing Academic Engagement by Activating a Connected Possible Identity</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Lewin (1942) proposed that goal engagement in the face of difficulty depends on seeing time as extending beyond one’s present situation to include a meaningful and inspiring future goal. In some cases people represent a future goal in the form of a possible identity—an image of the self that one could become. 
        James (1890) noted earlier that people emotionally invest in desired possible identities such as “me as successful scholar” or “me as popular” and despair when they are not making progress toward attaining them. Formalizing these views, 
        Markus and Nurius (1986) proposed that a desired possible identity serves as a goal that provides direction and impetus for current planning, decision making, and goal-directed action.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Although salient desired possible identities are sometimes enough to motivate goal-directed action (
        Ruvolo &amp; Markus, 1992), this is not always the case (
        Oyserman, Bybee, Terry, &amp; Hart-Johnson, 2004). Instead, imagining a desired possible identity can boost optimism and positive feelings without prompting action (
        Gonzales, Burgess, &amp; Mobilio, 2001). Across studies, academic and career possible identities are sometimes, but not always, associated with increased academic engagement and performance (
        Kirk et al., 2012; 
        Strauss, Griffin, &amp; Parker, 2012; 
        Vansteenkiste, Simons, Soenens, &amp; Lens, 2004). Studies priming fitness and health-related possible identities reveal similarly inconsistent results (
        Dalley &amp; Buunk, 2011; 
        Hoyle &amp; Sherrill, 2006; 
        Murru &amp; Martin Ginis, 2010).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">This disparity between possible identities’ personal value and their limited impact on current action has been widely studied (e.g., 
        Gollwitzer &amp; Sheeran, 2006; 
        Oyserman, 2013; 
        Wakslak, Nussbaum, Liberman, &amp; Trope, 2008). People report valuing their future self as a truer representation of themselves than their current self (
        Wakslak, Trope, Liberman, &amp; Alony, 2006), yet they often choose immediate short-term gains over longer term rewards, a phenomenon captured in the large literature on temporal discounting (e.g., 
        Ballard &amp; Knutson, 2009; 
        Chapman &amp; Elstein, 1995; 
        Thaler, 1981). One explanation for this disparity is that people fail to notice that now is the time to act (
        Gollwitzer &amp; Sheeran, 2006). This suggests that one solution is to focus on specific strategies for action (termed 
        <em>implementation intentions</em>), such as “When I get out of class, I’ll immediately sit down and reread my notes,” instead of thinking about a possible identity in more global terms (
        Gollwitzer &amp; Sheeran, 2006).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Another explanation is that people fail to fully appreciate the connection between their current actions and a possible identity that may or may not be realized in the remote future. Unless something in the context clarifies the connection between present and future and, in so doing, affirms that strategies for action are needed, people may fail to act in the present (
        Oyserman, 2013). For example, doing homework, eating a healthy diet, and exercising regularly might feel like a good investments if the present feels connected to desired possible identities as a “successful college graduate” or “healthy me”; otherwise these activities are more likely to feel like chores to be shirked (
        Oyserman &amp; James, 2009).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">This suggests that one means of increasing academic engagement is to make explicit the connection between one’s current identity and academic possible identity. A number of studies support this hypothesis (
        Ersner-Hershfield, Garton, Ballard, Samanez-Larkin, &amp; Knutson, 2009; 
        Hershfield et al., 2011). In one, students who described their future career success as dependent on their academic success studied more than students who did not (
        Destin &amp; Oyserman, 2010). In a follow-up study, children were shown either a stepwise graph in which each increment in education yielded higher average income or a graph of the incomes of top actors, athletes, and musicians. Children led to believe that school success was an effective means of attaining financial success studied more and turned in more homework than the other children (
        Destin &amp; Oyserman, 2010). In another study, students were simply asked how connected their current and future “adult” identities felt, and those who reported more connection worked harder on school tasks (
        Nurra &amp; Oyserman, 2011).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In an experimental replication of this effect, students assigned to consider the connection (vs. disconnection) between their current and adult identities worked harder on academic tasks (
        Nurra &amp; Oyserman, 2011). Content coding revealed that the adult identity being described almost always involved a career, with the implication that seeing a future identity as connected to the current identity encourages schoolwork by making it seem like a step on the path to attaining a successful possible identity.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">These studies strongly suggest, but do not test, the prediction that the journey metaphor used by many colleges works in the same way. That is, students thinking about their possible identity as academically accomplished graduates might use the journey metaphor to connect that possible identity to their current identity through a sequence of actions that begins in the present. This should, in turn, increase their academic intention and prompt them to invest more effort into academic tasks. To articulate more fully why this might be the case, we turn to conceptual metaphor theory and the growing body of research on metaphor’s role in cognition.</p><a id="psp-106-5-679-EFDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_25" title="Conceptual Metaphor Theory and Research">Conceptual Metaphor Theory and Research</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Conceptual metaphor theory posits that metaphor is not merely a communication device, as is traditionally assumed; rather, it is a cognitive tool that people can use to understand one concept in terms of a superficially dissimilar concept (
        Gibbs, 1994; 
        Kövecses, 2010; 
        Lakoff &amp; Johnson, 1980, 
        1999). The concept people try to understand (the “target”) is typically abstract, referring to entities and relations that cannot be directly observed; the other concept (the “source”) is typically more concrete, referring to perceptual and embodied experiences that are familiar, observable, and well understood (e.g., experiences of space, movement, containment).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Metaphor use facilitates understanding of the target by mentally mapping its characteristic features onto analogous features of the source. In this way, an accessible metaphor supports interpretations of the target that are consistent with knowledge of the source. More specifically, the metaphor transfers source knowledge in a way that highlights some target features and downplays others. Thinking about the same target in terms of an alternative source or without a metaphor will highlight and downplay different target features.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The current research builds on studies that prime metaphor experimentally by exposing participants to a metaphoric framing: a communication comparing (e.g., by means of words or images) a target and a source. The reasoning behind this empirical strategy is that if a metaphoric framing activates metaphor use, it should lead recipients to transfer their source knowledge to interpret analogous features of the target, even those that are not explicitly referred to in the communication. Supporting this reasoning, participants who read a message framing the stock market as a living agent (e.g., “the NASDAQ started 
        <em>climbing</em> upward”) were more likely to infer that price trends would continue along their current trajectory than participants who read a message framing the stock market as an inanimate object (“the NASDAQ was 
        <em>swept</em> upward”; 
        Morris, Sheldon, Ames, &amp; Young, 2007). Similarly, participants primed to frame a city’s crime problem as an aggressive animal were more supportive of punitive crime-reduction strategies than those primed to frame crime as a disease, who preferred to address the root causes of crime (
        Thibodeau &amp; Boroditsky, 2011). In each case, though not directly tested, effects were consistent with the hypothesized knowledge transfer process. That is, participants primed with an agent-metaphoric framing presumably transferred their knowledge of living agents (they move with intention) to interpret the target, while those primed with a disease-metaphoric framing transferred their knowledge of curing disease (address root causes).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">There is some experimental evidence that primed metaphors influence self-perceptions. Studies show that priming bodily cues associated with source concepts (e.g., tasting something sweet, looking up) changes perceptions of target personality traits (e.g., agreeableness, dominance) in directions consistent with conventional metaphors (
        Meier, Moeller, Riemer-Peltz, &amp; Robinson, 2012; 
        Robinson &amp; Fetterman, 2013). Yet no prior studies have examined the potential for primed metaphors to influence people’s understanding of the person they may become in the future. Also, no prior studies have examined consequences of metaphor use for motivational outcomes.
      </p><a id="psp-106-5-679-EEDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_31" title="The Goal-as-Journey Metaphor and Identity-Based Motivation">The Goal-as-Journey Metaphor and Identity-Based Motivation</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">People commonly talk about future goals in journey-metaphoric terms: “choose the right 
        <em>path</em>,” “get a good 
        <em>start</em>,” “I 
        <em>see where</em> I need 
        <em>to go</em>,” “Once I 
        <em>get to</em> that 
        <em>place</em> I can decide to 
        <em>keep going</em> or 
        <em>take a different direction</em>” (
        Lakoff, 1993; 
        Lakoff &amp; Johnson, 1999). The journey metaphor also pervades communication strategies to encourage various goal-directed behaviors. In addition to being used by colleges in their orientation materials, the journey metaphor is used by physicians to encourage their patients to maintain health and treatment routines (
        Penson, Schapira, Daniels, Chabner, &amp; Lynch, 2004). Advertisers encourage consumers to choose their product to embark on a journey toward a healthier, wealthier, or more attractive version of themselves (
        Ágnes, 2009; 
        Milne, Kearins, &amp; Walton, 2006). Influential leaders such as Martin Luther King Jr., Winston Churchill, and Barack Obama have attempted to rally civic action by describing a physical journey toward a state of the nation as egalitarian, prosperous, or victorious over evil (
        Charteris-Black, 2011). These qualitative examples provide suggestive evidence that framing a future goal using the journey metaphor uniquely increases engagement with that goal.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Stronger support comes from evidence that using the journey metaphor to think about personal identity over time influences self-perceptions that are closely related to those that predict possible identity engagement. 
        Keefer, Landau, Rothschild, and Sullivan (2011) showed that individuals primed to frame separate episodes from their past as locations along a path (versus without a metaphor) perceived those past experiences as more strongly connected to their current identity. It is possible that framing a possible future identity using the journey metaphor will similarly make that identity feel more connected to one’s current identity. And, as we noted earlier, studies show that a strong perceived connection to a possible identity spurs individuals to engage with that identity in the present (
        Oyserman, 2013). The current studies integrate these prior findings to assess the journey metaphor’s impact on engagement. They are also the first to directly examine the knowledge transfer process that is theorized to mediate metaphor priming effects.
      </p><a id="psp-106-5-679-EDDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_35" title="Overview of the Current Studies">Overview of the Current Studies</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Studies 1–3 test the prediction that priming students with a journey-metaphoric framing of their desired academic possible identity will increase their academic engagement. College students randomly assigned to this key priming condition thought about themselves in the future as an academically accomplished college graduate. Using the metaphoric framing procedure described earlier, we primed these participants to visualize their academic possible identity as a destination on a physical path representing their college career. We assessed the generalizability of the predicted effect by testing whether it replicated across two operational definitions of academic engagement used in prior research: academic intention (Study 1) and effort (Studies 2 and 3). We also test whether this effect persists over time as reflected in test performance a week following the priming manipulation (Study 3).</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Following this first set of studies, we present our model of the processes underlying the journey metaphor’s hypothesized effect on engagement. Briefly stated, this model specifies that using the journey metaphor to frame a possible identity results in a transfer of the procedural confidence associated with physical journeys to understand a possible identity, bolstering confidence that one knows the procedure necessary to attain that identity. This procedural confidence makes a possible identity feel more connected to one’s current identity, and this identity connection in turn increases engagement (as demonstrated in prior research on identity-based motivation). Study 4 tests whether a journey-metaphoric framing of a possible identity strengthens identity connection by increasing procedural confidence. Studies 5 and 6 test the mediating role of identity connection in predicting engagement. Study 6 extends the model beyond the academic domain to test whether journey-enhanced identity connection predicts engagement with a variety of desired possible identities reported by working adults. Study 7 tests the hypothesis, derived from our theoretical integration, that a journey-metaphoric framing will particularly benefit individuals who generally perceive a weak connection to their possible identity.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">To test whether our key priming condition uniquely improves academic engagement, we included comparison conditions that differ along three critical dimensions: whether the salient possible identity focuses on academics or another domain; whether an academic possible identity is framed with the journey metaphor, no provided metaphor, a different metaphor for time, or a passive journey metaphor; and whether the primed identity refers to past achievements or future success. The introduction to each study provides details of the comparisons used.</p><a id="psp-106-5-679-ECDDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Samples</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Given our focus on academic engagement and academic possible identities, we recruited students enrolled in introductory psychology courses who received course credit or extra credit (Study 3). The exceptions were our pilot study and Study 6, in which we recruited adult samples from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (
          Buhrmester, Kwang, &amp; Gosling, 2011). Recruiting an online sample in Study 6 enabled us to test whether and how the journey metaphor influences engagement with possible identities in domains other than academics.

          Simmons, Nelson, and Simonsohn (2011). This minimum cell size goal was met except in Study 2, in which data were collected at the end of the semester and many participants did not follow task instructions, leaving us with cell sizes between 17 and 18 (see

          Table 1 provides a distribution of race–ethnicity by study. Because Caucasian and Asian Americans formed three quarters or more of each sample, our analysis of possible race–ethnicity effects was underpowered. Research on stereotype threat suggests that negative stereotypic expectancies on academic tasks are likely to be salient for African American, Hispanic American, and American Indian students (
          Steele et al., 2002). Therefore, we combined these racial–ethnic categories and compared them to those of Caucasian and Asian students. We found a main effect of gender in Study 7, as described in that study. We did not find any interaction between gender or race–ethnicity and our predictor variables.

For target identity, one group was asked to think about themselves as socially accomplished college graduates. Establishing social relationships is a major goal in college and a common PI in free-response studies (
          Oyserman &amp; James, 2011), but it is irrelevant to academic engagement. For framing, one group was primed to frame their academic PI without a provided metaphor. Another group framed their academic PI as an entity located inside a container representing their senior year. Like the journey metaphor, the goal-as-contained-entity framing is commonly used to communicate about goals (e.g., one 
          <em>enters</em> and 
          <em>exits</em> an academic year).
          <a id="b-fn1"> </a><sup /> Yet people generally know that entities located inside separate, bounded containers do not influence one another (
          Lakoff, 1993; 
          Lakoff &amp; Johnson, 1980). In fact, studies show that people perceive a weak connection between their current identity and past events that are metaphorically placed inside containers (
          Li, Wei, &amp; Soman, 2010). When used to frame a PI, the container metaphor implies that engagement is necessary once one is “in” the future, but not before (
          Gentner, Imai, &amp; Boroditsky, 2002), and was therefore not expected to increase academic engagement.

Students in this condition showed stronger academic intention than students primed to frame their academic PI without a provided metaphor and using a different metaphor (as an entity in a separate container), as well as those who thought about a PI in a different domain (the “social me”). Still, it is possible that the observed effect is due simply to the salience of the journey metaphor itself, rather than a journey-framed academic PI specifically. Perhaps the “journey” is simply a cliché symbol of motivation that globally cues action in any accessible domain. We assessed this alternative possibility in Study 2 by including two comparison conditions in which participants used the journey metaphor to frame different target identities.</p><a id="psp-106-5-679-EBCDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Study 2: Academic Effort</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In Study 2 we operationalized academic engagement as effort on academic tasks.

In two comparison conditions students were primed to use the journey metaphor to frame their social PI or a past academic achievement.

Specifically, they were instructed:

How well you perform on these problems is a reliable indicator of your overall academic ability.” Participants were presented with 50 math problems and told to solve as many as they could in a 5-min period without the use of scratch paper or a calculator. Each problem involved summing three two-digit numbers (e.g., 54 + 28 + 89). Materials and instructions were from previous research on intellectual task engagement (

We found converging effects across two operational definitions of academic engagement (academic intention and effort), and we found that the effort-inducing effect persists up to a week later. We also found evidence that this effect is due specifically to using the journey metaphor to frame an academic PI. Students who framed their academic PI using a different metaphor for time or who were not provided a metaphor did not show increased academic engagement. In addition, a primed journey metaphor did not increase engagement when used to frame a different PI (“me as socially accomplished college graduate”) or a past academic achievement. In the second set of studies, we take a closer look at the cognitive processes underlying this effect.</p><a id="psp-106-5-679-EBDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_105" title="Part 2: The Journey Metaphor Transfers Procedural Confidence, Increasing Possible Identity Connection and Engagement">Part 2: The Journey Metaphor Transfers Procedural Confidence, Increasing Possible Identity Connection and Engagement</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">How does a journey-metaphoric framing of a possible identity increase engagement with that identity? Generally, priming makes knowledge temporarily accessible and thus available for perception and judgment (for a review, see 
        Förster &amp; Liberman, 2007). An accessible metaphor is posited to be unique in that it transfers knowledge of a source concept to help people understand and process a target concept, despite the two concepts’ surface differences (
        Kövecses, 2010; 
        Lakoff &amp; Johnson, 1980). The results of prior studies imply, but do not test, the proposition that priming a metaphoric framing is an effective means of triggering metaphoric transfer, because it leads recipients to interpret the target (e.g., stock market trends, crime) consistent with their source knowledge (e.g., intentional agents, disease; 
        Morris et al., 2007; 
        Thibodeau &amp; Boroditsky, 2011). Going further, we directly test the prediction that priming a journey-metaphoric framing of a goal cues observers to transfer their knowledge of physical journeys to interpret that goal. But what do people know about journeys?
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We focus on the 
        <em>procedural knowledge</em> people have about physical journeys. A procedure is a sequence of actions required to attain a goal (
        Wyer, Shen, Hao, &amp; Xu, 2013). Throughout the life span people routinely move forward along paths toward desired locations. They toddle across rooms to reach toys, walk down streets and sidewalks toward buildings and gatherings, and run across parking lots to get to work on time. From these recurring embodied experiences, people acquire confident knowledge that, on a journey, the path in front of them designates a sequence of individual steps that they must take to move from “here” (current location) to “there” (destination). Using the journey metaphor to conceptualize a goal transfers this procedural confidence, helping people to concretely grasp how their current activities fit into a sequence of actions necessary to achieve (or “get to”) that goal (
        Gibbs, 1994; 
        Lakoff, 1993; 
        Lakoff &amp; Johnson, 1980).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">On the basis of this theorizing, we hypothesized that priming a journey-metaphoric framing of a possible identity would bolster procedural confidence about that identity, and that this procedural confidence would increase felt connection between current and possible identities. Increasing people’s confidence that they know how to attain a possible identity should increase their sense that it is a realistic goal and thus a meaningful part of their current identity rather than an abstract and remote possibility. Consistent with this hypothesis is evidence that students report feeling more connected to an academic possible identity if they are additionally prompted to delineate strategies for achieving that goal (
        Oyserman, Johnson, &amp; James, 2011). Yet this work did not examine whether metaphor use can increase procedural confidence and hence identity connection. We test whether the journey-metaphoric framing’s effect on identity connection is mediated by procedural confidence in Study 4.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Our second theoretically guided hypothesis was that priming a journey-metaphoric framing of a possible identity increases engagement by means of increasing identity connection. This hypothesis follows from the integration of two prior findings: perceived identity connection is a key antecedent of engagement with a possible identity (
        Oyserman &amp; Destin, 2010), and using the journey metaphor to frame temporally remote aspects of one’s identity increases their perceived connection to one’s current identity (
        Keefer et al., 2011). Studies 5 and 6 test this hypothesis, in Study 5 with a sample of college freshmen focused on their academic possible identity and in Study 6 with a sample of adults focused on a desired possible identity 4 years in the future. In Study 7 we applied our integrative model to examine how individual differences moderate the journey metaphor’s motivating effect. If this metaphor spurs engagement by strengthening identity connection, as we hypothesize, it should be particularly beneficial for individuals who perceive a weak connection to their possible identity.

A pilot study tested this assumption. Mechanical Turk workers (
          <em>N</em> = 71; 51% female, 74% White; 
          <em>M</em>age = 30.77 years) rated their agreement with three items assessing confidence in procedural knowledge of traveling along a physical path: “I can clearly see what steps I need to take to reach my destination”; “I am unclear about the steps required to reach the destination” (reverse scored); “I am aware of everything I have to do to reach the destination” (1 = s
          <em>trongly disagree</em>, 7 = s
          <em>trongly agree</em>; α = .90). Then they were asked to imagine a successful future self in a personally valued domain (using a slightly modified version of the academic and social PI writing prompts used thus far) and then rate how confidently they know the procedure necessary to attain that possible identity: “I have a clear idea of how to achieve my goal”; “I am not sure what exactly I need to do to achieve my goal” (reverse scored); “I understand the smaller goals I’ll need to achieve to accomplish my goal” (α = .82). A dependent samples

The active journey condition framed the self as walking along a path representing the college career, which requires awareness of the path and steps necessary to reach the destination. The passive journey condition, in contrast, framed the self as carried along that path in a vehicle following a predetermined route, which implies that one inevitably reaches the destination without considering the path or steps necessary to get there. We predicted that the active (vs. passive) journey framing would strengthen PI procedural confidence and, consequently, increase identity connection.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Method</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">KU freshmen (
            <em>N</em> = 56; 67% female, 70% White) first completed the academic PI prime used in the previous studies and were then instructed to think about that identity as the destination at the end of a blank image of a path. Next, they completed a guided visualization task in which they imagined themselves as a student at three stages of their college career traveling toward that final, accomplished self. The stages were labeled “Current School Activities,” “Junior 
            <em>or</em> Sophomore Year,” and “1st Semester Senior.” They were arranged chronologically beginning with current activities on the nearest part of the path and advancing along the path with each stage.
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We manipulated how the college journey was framed. In the active journey framing, the representation of the stages depicted a figure (gender and ethnicity neutral) actively walking forward (see 
            Figure 3, left panel). Written instructions bolstered this image’s suggestion of self-directed motion along a path (e.g., “Imagine yourself on the road walking toward your goal”). In the passive journey condition, the active figure was replaced with an image of a train car traveling toward the academic possible self (see 
            Figure 3, right panel), and instructions bolstered the implication of passive transport (e.g., “Imagine yourself aboard this train riding toward your goal”). We used a simpler, line-drawn path image rather than the photographic path images used in the previous studies so as to convincingly depict it as either a footpath or part of a rail line, depending on condition.

To test this, we designed Study 6 to replicate and extend Study 5 using broad measures of identity connection and engagement capable of accommodating PIs in a range of domains. Again, we operationalized engagement as intention to prioritize activities necessary to attain the target PI.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Study 6 also addresses a potential limitation of the container framing procedure used in Studies 1–3. In those studies we used images of trunks (see

Yet participants are unlikely to have everyday experience moving in and out of containers like these, and the trunk images may even carry morbid connotations. It is therefore possible that journey framing increased engagement over container framing simply because participants in the latter condition found it difficult to conceptually map their PI pursuit onto an unfamiliar experience. To compare the effects of alternative metaphoric framings more precisely, we modified the container framing materials to depict years as houses increasing in size and extravagance as participants imagined pursuing their PI.

Participants generated PIs in various domains: “I see myself in a position/career that allows me to make a difference in people’s lives through philanthropic work. I am the director of a nonprofit group that helps women, girls and the environment”; “In four years I’ll be totally debt-free.

This effect emerged across four journey framing priming procedures: an interactive path image (Studies 1, 2, and 7), a sequential visualization task designed to eliminate between-condition differences in spatial position (Study 3), an active versus passive motion visualization task (Studies 4 and 6), and a subtle path image (Study 5). Hence, the effects found in any given study are unlikely to be due to idiosyncratic features of its priming procedure.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Furthermore, the motivating effect of a journey-framed possible identity generalized across a range of outcomes. Predicted effects emerged on two indices of engagement—intention to prioritize possible identity-relevant activities (Studies 1, 3, 5–7) and effort on those activities (Studies 2 and 3)—using various operationalizations of each outcome. Also, the effect generalized across engagement with an academic possible identity (Studies 1–5, 7) as well as desired possible identities in other domains (Study 6). The practical significance of this effect is attested to by its ability to predict actual exam performance up to a week after the priming manipulation (Study 3).</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The current studies establish internal validity by demonstrating the specific effect of priming an academic possible identity framed using the (active) journey metaphor. This condition increased engagement compared to conditions differing solely on framing (using either a different metaphor for time, goal-as-contained-entity, or no provided metaphor), possible identity content (academic vs. social), and time frame (possible vs. past academic identity). We refined the container-metaphoric framing condition to rule out between-condition differences in spatial positioning (Study 3) and ease of conceptual mapping (Study 6). In this way, the results provide strong evidence that the primary predicted effect results from use of the journey metaphor in particular, and not simply any metaphor. Including comparison conditions priming journey-framed social and past academic identities increases our confidence that the primary predicted effect is not merely due to using the journey metaphor to frame any desirable identity, even when that identity is relevant to academic success. Study 4 tested the role of a specific aspect of the journey metaphor—the self-as-traveler’s active movement along a path—to unpack which aspects of physical journeys specifically increase people’s connection to, and ultimately their engagement with, a possible identity.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In addition to demonstrating the robustness and specificity of the effect, the current studies programmatically explore the cognitive processes through which a journey-metaphoric framing increases possible identity engagement. As predicted on the basis of our process model, priming an active journey-framed possible identity increased participants’ confidence that they understood the procedure, or action sequence, necessary to attain that identity; in turn, procedural confidence predicted participants’ perception that their possible identity is meaningfully connected to their current identity (Study 4). In accord with prior research on identity-based motivation (
        Oyserman, 2013), increased identity connection predicted engagement with possible identities in academic and other personally valued domains (Studies 5 and 6). Also supporting our process model, a journey framing increased engagement particularly among individuals who previously perceived a weak connection to their possible identity (Study 7). In sum, our process model integrates identity-based motivation theory and conceptual metaphor theory to yield novel hypotheses about identity connection’s roles as an outcome of the journey metaphor, a mediator of this metaphor’s effect on possible identity engagement, and an individual difference moderator of the journey metaphor’s motivating effect.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">These findings cast doubt on the alternative interpretation that priming a journey-metaphoric framing of a possible identity increases engagement because of mere demand—that is, because participants felt pressure to adjust their behavior in light of a cliché symbol of motivation. Although plausible, this explanation cannot account for the fact that an active (vs. passive) journey framing bolstered procedural confidence of a possible identity, which in turn predicted strengthened identity connection (Study 4). The journey cliché does not distinguish between active and passive journey framings, but instead refers generally to forward motion along a path. In contrast, this distinction follows from our process model, which specifies that the concept of an active physical journey is associated with confident procedural knowledge about the steps necessary to reach a destination.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Several other findings challenge the demand interpretation. The effects were quite specific to the fit between the cued possible identity and the academic dependent variables. Participants who used the journey metaphor to imagine themselves as socially accomplished college graduates—which might be expected to trigger a college-as-a-journey cliché—did not show increased academic effort (Study 2) or intention (Study 5). The effect was robust to use of very subtle primes. Study 5 replicated the motivating effect of a journey-framed academic possible identity using a subtle priming procedure whereby participants were not explicitly asked to think about their possible academic identity as though it were a destination along a path. Also, Studies 5 and 6 provide converging evidence that the journey framing’s effect on engagement is mediated by strengthened identity connection. The journey-as-cliché interpretation would not predict and cannot account for this mediation. Finally, if a journey prime merely cues engagement, we would not expect its effects to be moderated by prior levels of identity connection (Study 7).</p><a id="psp-106-5-679-EDADA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Advancing Research on Conceptual Metaphor</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The current research makes five substantive contributions to the growing body of metaphor research in social psychology (for a review, see

The mainstream view is that the self-concept contains abstract pieces of knowledge about personal characteristics and experience (e.g., 
          Markus &amp; Wurf, 1987). Despite its intuitive appeal, this account may be incomplete. The current findings, combined with other evidence that metaphor use affects self-perceptions (
          Keefer et al., 2011; 
          Meier et al., 2012), suggest that representations of the self can be systematically structured around knowledge of superficially unrelated concepts derived from routine embodied experience.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Second, the current studies are the first to examine how metaphor use paired with cued identities affects motivational outcomes. Conceptual metaphor theory posits that accessible metaphors systematically structure how people think about and process target concepts. Prior studies have begun to substantiate this claim by demonstrating metaphoric influences on a range of social cognitive outcomes, including person perception, memory, and problem solving (
          Landau et al., 2013). However, this prior work sheds little light on the consequences of metaphor for deliberate action and personal goal striving. The current findings begin to broaden the empirical scope of metaphor research to study engagement and related psychological processes.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Third, the current research goes beyond prior work to directly examine the knowledge transfer process theorized to mediate metaphoric framing effects. As noted in the introduction, prior studies utilizing the metaphoric framing procedure manipulate exposure to a metaphoric framing and measure whether target perceptions change in the direction of what is presumed to be commonplace knowledge of the source. For example, 
          Morris et al. (2007) presupposed that study participants know that living agents normally move purposively along a trajectory. Similarly, 
          Thibodeau and Boroditsky (2011) assumed that people know that treating disease requires identifying root causes. While the results of these prior studies are consistent with expectations about how metaphors shape cognition, they do not show that exposure to metaphoric framing prompts any source-to-target knowledge transfer. The current research fills this gap by showing that a journey-metaphoric framing of a possible identity prompted recipients to transfer confident procedural knowledge of physical journeys to construct that identity and the downstream consequences of this process.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Fourth, we took multiple steps to show that the active journey-metaphoric framing in particular increases engagement. Very few studies on conceptual metaphor have attempted such a thorough examination of the discriminant validity of a metaphoric framing effect. We know of only three prior studies comparing metaphoric and nonmetaphoric framings of a given target (
          Keefer et al., 2011; 
          Landau, Sullivan, &amp; Greenberg, 2009; 
          Ottati, Rhoads, &amp; Graesser, 1999), yet none of these tested process models to explore why specifically these conditions differ, as we did in Study 5. We know of only two studies comparing alternative metaphoric framings of the same target (
          Morris et al., 2007; 
          Thibodeau &amp; Boroditsky, 2011), yet these did not attempt to unpack the processes involved, as we did in Study 6. In addition to testing the specific processes through which the journey metaphoric framing influences engagement, we provided the first study (Study 4) comparing different versions of the same metaphor to show which aspects of the source specifically affected our outcome measures.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">While these tests isolate the unique effect of the active journey metaphoric framing, our studies also show that the observed effects are specific to using this framing to construe the relevant target concept. To our knowledge, no prior study has compared a metaphoric framing of a particular target to conditions priming the same metaphor but used to frame alternative targets. As a result, we cannot conclusively say whether prior metaphoric framing effects are specific to using the metaphor to represent the target of interest (e.g., conceptualizing the stock market in particular as a living agent) or simply because of the salience of the source (e.g., living agents) or the metaphor itself (e.g., conceptualizing any complex system as a living agent). Our findings offer the first challenge to these alternatives. We compared our key priming condition to conditions priming a journey-metaphoric framing of a possible identity in another domain (social relationships; Studies 2 and 5) or past academic achievements (Study 2). Neither of these comparison conditions increased academic engagement, suggesting that the motivating effect of a journey-framed academic possible identity is not merely due to the salience of physical journeys or the use of the journey metaphor to construe any target concept.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Finally, Study 7 advances metaphor research by examining how individual difference factors moderate the effect of experimentally primed metaphors on perception. Individual differences in metaphoric cognition have received relatively little empirical attention (
          Robinson &amp; Fetterman, 2013), yet they are critical to understand if we are to have a full picture of metaphor’s role in social cognition.
        </p><a id="psp-106-5-679-ECADA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Advancing Research on Identity-Based Motivation</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">As we reviewed in the introduction, prior studies testing the effect of accessible possible identities on motivation have found only mixed evidence in favor of their benefits. The current research builds on identity-based motivation theory, which claims that perceived identity connection is a necessary bridge between an accessible possible identity and engagement with that identity in the present. We provided additional support for this claim by demonstrating the mediating role of identity connection in engagement.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">More generally, conceptual metaphor theory lends to the identity-based motivation perspective the insight that people may have difficulty conceptualizing a connection between the person they are today and a possible identity. The sheer abstractness of this connection makes it difficult to appreciate that current actions are relevant to becoming a better version of the self in the distant future. Metaphor—and in particular the journey metaphor—may be one particularly powerful cognitive device for gaining a clear and confident grasp of how temporally remote identities relate to one another. In this way, metaphor use can be potent means of fostering identity connection and thus engagement with possible identities.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Our process model also specifies the conditions under which people are likely to feel connection. We found in Study 4 that this connection is increased specifically by feeling more confident of what actions one needs to take to attain a possible identity (similar findings are reported in 
          Oyserman et al., 2011). This same increase in procedural confidence can be accomplished in many ways without metaphor, such as by forming detailed implementation intentions for future goals (
          Bayuk, Janiszewski, &amp; LeBoeuf, 2010; 
          Gollwitzer &amp; Sheeran, 2006). On the basis of the results of our studies, we expect that such practices may be beneficial for much the same reasons as the journey-metaphoric framing: by concretely visualizing the links between present and future, connection and engagement increase.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">While we provided detailed tests of the processes through which a journey-framed possible identity increases engagement, we have not compared its effect to other tested possible identity interventions (e.g., 
          Oyserman, Terry, &amp; Bybee, 2002). As it stands, we know that its motivating effect extends up to a week (Study 3), but it will be important to compare its efficacy and duration to other validated interventions.
        </p><a id="psp-106-5-679-EBADA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Limitations and Future Directions</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The current studies raise a number of questions that deserve attention. For one, we utilized relatively explicit priming procedures. Study 5 begins to address this limitation by using a subtler priming procedure, but participants were nevertheless consciously aware of the metaphoric imagery. It remains an open question whether implicit primes of a metaphoric framing have parallel effects. Future studies could examine, for example, the effect of subliminally presented sentences comparing goal pursuit to physical journeys (e.g., “You’re on the right path”). At the same time, we believe that the ecological validity of our priming procedures—which resemble the metaphoric imagery commonly used in educational, health-related, and political communications (
          Charteris-Black, 2011)—is a strength of the current research.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Because our studies focused primarily on college-aged (and older) participants, it is possible that the motivating effect of the journey metaphor does not extend to younger samples. Research shows that metaphor processing ability develops steadily over the elementary school years, but that metaphor comprehension also varies a great deal by the concepts employed in a metaphor (
          Keil, 1986). It may be that journeys are a well-known source even for children, so they may still be able to understand temporally remote aspects of identity in journey-metaphoric terms. Alternatively, because concepts for time also must be sufficiently developed to allow association with the journey source concept, it is possible that insufficient cognitive development may prevent mappings between the source and target. Future research should explore whether the motivating effect of the journey metaphor (or any metaphor) is constrained by developmental factors.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We acknowledge that procedural confidence only partially accounted for the effect of journey framing on identity connection. This leaves open the possibility that there are other aspects of journeys that we could have measured and that may play a significant mediating role. For example, the active journey metaphor may have cued the importance of perseverance, made a goal feel more meaningful by integrating it into a broader understanding of life, or made participants more aware of the contingent nature of goal attainment (i.e., that future goals depend on current success). Future research is necessary to examine whether and how knowledge of other journey features influences identity connection (and hence engagement).</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In examining how individual difference variables moderate metaphoric influences on perception, our guiding analysis led us to focus on preexisting perceptions of current/possible identity connection. Future studies should explore the moderating role of other relevant factors. One promising direction is to examine variability in knowledge about physical journeys. Although some aspects of movement along a path may be experienced universally, there are certainly important cultural and individual differences in people’s journey knowledge. For example, individuals raised in rural settings, in which residences are located far apart, may be more likely than their urban-raised counterparts to expect journeys to require sustained effort, while urban individuals may expect journeys to be relatively more dangerous or unpleasant. Aside from physical ecology, experience with transportation technology likely changes how journeys are understood. Individuals with ready access to cars, trains, and airplanes may view journeys as relatively common.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The upshot of this variability is that when people are prompted to transfer journey knowledge to make sense of goal pursuit, they may exhibit different patterns of belief, attitudes, and behavior, despite using the “same” metaphor. For example, we might expect that among students primed to view a class assignment as a journey, those raised in rural settings will prepare to put significant effort into the assignment, and to spend a long time on it, while their peers from the big city will anticipate completing the assignment quickly, but not without significant stress.</p><a id="psp-106-5-679-EAADA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Implications for Practice and Intervention</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The foregoing qualifications aside, we believe that the current studies make a strong empirical case that a journey-metaphoric framing of a possible identity has a practically significant impact on motivation. An obvious implication of this discovery is that colleges should continue to include journey-metaphoric framings in their orientation materials, particularly early in the college career when an image of the self as an accomplished college graduate seems most abstract and removed from the practical realities of day-to-day life. Sports teams, health communicators, and corporations could similarly employ journey-framed communications to encourage goal-directed action. The current research also points to parameters of this effect. For instance, the results of Study 4 suggest that people are unlikely to be motivated in response to a journey-framed communication that depicts them as passively being transported along a predetermined path toward a goal.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Of course, a number of other interventions have been shown to increase academic engagement and student success, both in the present and throughout the school career (
          Oyserman et al., 2002). For instance, in the School-to-Jobs program developed by 
          Oyserman et al. (2002), a timeline was used to encourage students to see the connections between present actions and their goals. It is possible, however, that the journey metaphor is a more vivid and effective method of accomplishing this same task. By encouraging students to see the steps necessary for achieving their future success, the metaphor may be a uniquely beneficial tool for motivating student success.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">A further implication is that individuals and groups may want to guard themselves against the power of journey-framed communications encouraging them to pursue goals that, though initially attractive, are not ultimately in their best personal or collective interest. While leaders like Martin Luther King Jr. employed the journey metaphor to motivate collective action for civil rights, this metaphor has been used just as effectively to increase support for eugenic policies framed as unpleasant yet necessary “steps” on the way to a glorious future (
          Rash, 2006). To the extent that individuals recognize the motivating effects of the journey metaphor, they may be able to reap its benefits while avoiding potential pitfalls.
