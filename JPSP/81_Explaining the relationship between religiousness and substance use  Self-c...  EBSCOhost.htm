Building on prior theoretical work, our studies suggest that self-control mediates the relationship between religiousness and a variety of substance-use behaviors. Study 1 showed that daily prayer predicted lower alcohol use on subsequent days. In Study 2, religiousness related to lower alcohol use, which was mediated by self-control. Study 3 replicated this mediational pattern using a behavioral measure of self-control. Using a longitudinal design, Study 4 revealed that self-control mediated the relationship between religiousness and lower alcohol use 6 weeks later. Study 5 replicated this mediational pattern again and showed that it remained significant after controlling for trait mindfulness. Studies 6 and 7 replicated and extended these effects to both alcohol and various forms of drug use among community and cross-cultural adult samples. These findings offer novel evidence regarding the role of self-control in explaining why religiousness is associated with lower substance use.

        Sanderson &amp; Roberts, 2008). Religiousness relates to various health indicators, including lower substance use (e.g., 
        Benda, Pope, &amp; Kelleher, 2006; 
        Gartner, Larson, &amp; Allen, 1991; 
        Gorsuch, 1995;

        Koopmans, Slutske, van Baal, &amp; Boomsma, 1999; 
        Miller, 1998). Yet, little research has examined whether self-control helps explain why religiousness predicts lower substance use.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The current investigation fills this gap in the literature by proposing that the benefits of religiousness on lower substance use are mediated by self-control. In a recent review, 
        McCullough and Willoughby (2009) proposed that religion enhances self-control, which promotes health. Most religions teach their followers to exercise self-control. Followers refrain from eating tempting foods, control their attention by reading and memorizing scriptural passages, override selfish impulses in order to behave prosocially, and engage in behaviors that promote, rather than hinder, their health. Therefore, self-control may account for part of the relationship between religiousness and lower substance use.

Substance use increases risky sexual behavior, depression, sexual assault, and even mortality (e.g., 
        Abbey, 2002; 
        Arasteh, Des Jarlais, &amp; Perlis, 2008; 
        Cooper, 2002; 
        Fergusson, Horwood, &amp; Swain-Campbell, 2002; 
        Hallfors et al., 2004; 
        Jones, Oeltmann, Wilson, Brener, &amp; Hill, 2001; 
        Kapner, 2008; 
        Leino et al., 1998). Alcohol and drug use also tend to co-occur, which poses an even greater risk to physical and mental health. Given the considerable negative consequences of substance use for health, it is desirable to identify factors associated with lower substance use.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Religiousness is such a factor. Some religions, such as Islam, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, certain sects of Hinduism, and schools of Buddhism forbid substance use. Even when one’s religion does not prohibit substance use, stronger religious commitment often relates to less substance use (e.g., 
        Benda et al., 2006; 
        Ford &amp; Hill, 2012; 
        Gartner et al., 1991; 
        Gorsuch, 1995; 
        Hill &amp; McCullough, 2008; 
        Humphreys &amp; Gifford, 2006; 
        Johnson et al., 2008; 
        Kendler et al., 2003; 
        H. G. Koenig et al., 2001; 
        Koopmans et al., 1999; 
        Miller, 1998; 
        Regnerus &amp; Elder, 2003). Experimentally manipulating religious behavior and cognition, such as prayer, reduces alcohol consumption (
        Lambert, Fincham, Marks, &amp; Stillman, 2010). One review summarized, “There seems to be little argument that greater religiosity is associated with lesser substance use” (
        Spilka, Hood, Hunsberger, &amp; Gorsuch, 2003, p. 423).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">What remains unclear, however, is whether self-control helps explain why religiousness predicts lower substance use. The next section offers theoretical and empirical support for our prediction: Self-control mediates the relationship between religiousness and lower substance use.</p><a id="psp-107-2-339-EJDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_12" title="Might Self-Control Help Explain the Link Between Religiousness and Lower Substance?">Might Self-Control Help Explain the Link Between Religiousness and Lower Substance?</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We test a theoretical framework synthesizes and explains relations between religiousness and substance use (
        McCullough &amp; Willoughby, 2009). 
        McCullough and Willoughby (2009) proposed that self-control may help explain well-replicated findings that link religiousness to better health, including lower substance-use behaviors. At first glance, this proposal seems plausible: Self-control, the ability to override one’s impulses so that one can remain in line with personal and social standards (
        Baumeister, Heatherton, &amp; Tice, 1994), predicts lower substance use (
        Johnston, O’Malley, &amp; Bachman, 1991; 
        Tangney, Baumeister, &amp; Boone, 2004; 
        Williamson, 1990). People who have good self-control tend to drink less alcohol and use fewer drugs (
        Conner, Stein, &amp; Longshore, 2009; 
        Pearson, Kite, &amp; Henson, 2013; 
        Wills, Ainette, Stoolmiller, Gibbons, &amp; Shinar, 2008). Experimental manipulations that impair self-control cause people to drink more alcohol (
        Christiansen, Cole, &amp; Field, 2012).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">McCullough and Willoughby’s (2009) review showed consistent support for a link between religiousness and better self-control. For example, compared to less religious people, highly religious people have longer lives (
        McCullough, Friedman, Enders, &amp; Martin, 2009; 
        McCullough, Hoyt, Larson, Koenig, &amp; Thoresen, 2000), consume less tobacco (
        Islam &amp; Johnson, 2003), and exhibit less aggressive and criminal behavior (
        Baier &amp; Wright, 2001; 
        Ellison &amp; Anderson, 2001). Experimental prayer manipulations, compared to people in no prayer conditions, cause people to report engaging in less romantic infidelity (
        Fincham, Lambert, &amp; Beach, 2010) and to cooperate more after provocation (
        Lambert, Fincham, DeWall, Pond, &amp; Beach, 2013). Moreover, religious images, and bringing religious concepts to mind, aid in coping with stressors (e.g., 
        Inzlicht &amp; Tullett, 2010; 
        Weisbuch-Remington, Mendes, Seery, &amp; Blascovich, 2005) and improve self-control performance (
        Rounding, Lee, Jacobson, &amp; Ji, 2012). Thus, a large body of work suggests a close link between indicators of religiousness and effective self-control.
      </p><a id="psp-107-2-339-EIDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_16" title="Present Studies">Present Studies</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Here, we present the results of a programmatic test of the hypothesis that self-control mediates the relationship between religiousness and lower substance use. To our knowledge, only four previously published studies have explored this question. All four relied on samples of early and middle adolescents (
        Desmond, Ulmer, &amp; Bader, 2013; 
        Kim-Spoon, Farley, Holmes, Longo, &amp; McCullough, 2014; 
        Kim-Spoon, McCullough, Bickel, Farley, &amp; Longo, 2014; 
        Walker, Ainette, Wills, &amp; Mendoza, 2007). Compared to younger adolescents, college students and adults consume more alcohol and drugs, and they are also at greater risk for substance-use problems. Hence, the links among religion, self-control, and substance use merit examination in people who are beyond middle and high school. We explored these linkages in diverse set of samples, including college student samples and samples of community-dwelling adults from the United States and four Asian countries. An additional strength is that we examined these associations at both the between-persons level and the within-persons level in hopes of gaining better purchase on how such causal associations might occur (
        Borsboom, Mellenbergh, &amp; van Heerden, 2003).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">An additional unique contribution is our effort to ensure that the associations of religion, self-control, and substance use are not caused by previously unconsidered confounds. In particular, our studies evaluate whether the mediational effects of lower substance use through heightened self-control remain significant after controlling for social desirability, which is a known correlate of religiousness (in particular in U.S. samples; 
        Sedikides &amp; Gebauer, 2010). We also examined whether our effects would remain significant after controlling for a non-religious mental state associated with self-awareness and contemplation—mindfulness. Whereas religiousness encompasses individual beliefs, practices, and dedications (
        Worthington et al., 2003), mindfulness refers to a “receptive attention to and awareness of present events and experience” (
        Brown, Ryan, &amp; Creswell, 2007, p. 212). Religiousness often depends in part on a supernatural agent, whereas mindfulness does not. Religious people, by definition, associate themselves with a particular religion, whereas mindfulness practitioners may or may not identify as religious (
        Longo &amp; Peterson, 2002). Hence, religiousness may continue to predict lower substance use even after controlling for mindfulness.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Also, we examined the potential moderating effects of participant gender, for two reasons. First, compared to women, men often consume more alcohol and drugs and have poorer self-control (e.g., 
        Back, Payne, Simpson, &amp; Brady, 2010; 
        Brady, Back, &amp; Greenfield, 2009; 
        Geisner, Larimer, &amp; Neighbors, 2004; 
        Kahler, Read, Wood, &amp; Palfai, 2003; 
        Stoltenberg, Batien, &amp; Birgenheir, 2008). Second, women tend to be more religious than men—particularly in the West (
        Francis &amp; Penny, 2013). Therefore, it seemed prudent to ensure that any apparent mediational relationships we discovered were not due to the confounding effects of gender.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Thus, the current investigation is unmatched in its scope in testing the hypothesis that self-control mediates the relationship between religiousness and lower substance use. We predicted that self-control would mediate the association between religiousness and lower substance use, although we expected the size of the mediating effect to be in the small-to-medium range, given the often small size of mediating effects (
        Preacher &amp; Kelley, 2011; 
        Shrout &amp; Bolger, 2002) and the small-to-moderate sizes of the bivariate relationships among religiousness, self-control, and substance use that previous research led us to anticipate.

It remains unclear how the relationship between religiousness and lower alcohol use unfolds in people’s everyday lives. To date, no study has investigated whether religious activities reported daily over a period of time, such as prayer, predict lower alcohol use concurrently or prospectively. Because daily prayer may occur before, during, or after one’s alcohol use, its relation to concurrent alcohol use may not be reliable. Moreover, in this diary study, participants reported on their daily prayer and alcohol consumption at the end of the day, which left the timing of each activity unclear. That is, daily prayer may have occurred before, during, or after the alcohol consumption. Because previous research has shown that prayer has a causal effect on reducing self-reported alcohol consumption (
        Lambert et al., 2010), how much alcohol a person consumes may be estimated most effectively by their previous day’s prayer.

          <em>M</em> = 9.24). The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for daily alcohol use was 0.32, suggesting significant within- and between-person variability. We next constructed a multilevel model with lagged Level 1 predictors that were group-mean centered (i.e., person-centered), which eliminated the influence of person-level differences on parameter estimates of mean lagged daily prayer and mean lagged daily alcohol consumption (
          Nezlek, 2001, 
          2011). In within-person analyses, a participant’s coefficient for lagged daily prayer describes the relationship between deviations from his or her mean lagged daily prayer level and deviations from his or her mean daily alcohol consumption level.

Participants completed a self-report measure of religiousness, a behavioral measure of self-control, and a self-report measure of alcohol use. The self-control measure was a delay discounting task, in which participants reported their preferences for future versus current monetary rewards. Overriding impulses for immediate gratification is a core feature of self-control and is associated with a variety of desirable outcomes (
        Audrain-McGovern et al., 2009; 
        Kollins, 2003; 
        Oberlin &amp; Grahame, 2009; 
        Reynolds et al., 2007). Preliminary evidence suggests that discounting can be used to understand the relationship between religiousness and substance use among adolescents (
        Kim-Spoon, McCullough, et al., 2014). Therefore, we predicted that religiousness would be related to placing a greater value on future (vs. immediate) monetary rewards, which would in turn predict lower alcohol use.

              Kirby &amp; Maraković, 1996). Because people tend to discount near future rewards more than distant future rewards (
              Frederick, Loewenstein, &amp; O’Donoghue, 2002; 
              Green &amp; Myerson, 2004), estimating a hyperbolic discounting function is preferable to an exponential function. Participants’ answers on the 27 binary choice items (e.g., “Would you prefer $20 today or $55 in 7 days?”) are used to estimate 
              <em>k</em> for 3 magnitudes of reward: small ($25–$35), medium ($50–$60), and large ($75–$85).

Because there was a chance that each response was worth real money, the experimenter encouraged participants to thoroughly consider each choice. When participants finished the MCQ, the experimenter handed them four poker cards. Participants then selected one of the four cards, one of which was an ace. If participants selected an ace, they pulled a number from a bag, which corresponded to an MCQ item. After participants had pulled a number, the experimenter gave them the amount chosen on the item. If participants received a delayed payment (e.g., $80 in 14 days), the experimenter made an appointment to pay them at the appropriate time.</p><a id="psp-107-2-339-EAFDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Results and Discussion</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Because one of our variables was a latent variable reflecting more than one indicator of discounting, data were analyzed with structural equation modeling (SEM) in Mplus Version 4.21 (
          Muthén &amp; Muthén, 2004). To create the latent discounting variable, only the estimates of 
          <em>k</em>s for medium and small magnitude rewards were used; 
          <em>k</em> for large rewards was so highly correlated with 
          <em>k</em> for medium rewards that when it was included as an indicator, its standardized loading on the latent variable exceeded 1.0, suggesting that a more appropriate approach was to only include 
          <em>k</em> values for small and large rewards. The magnitude of the reward is known to effect rates of discounting (i.e., larger rewards relate to steeper discounting functions). Creating a latent variable for discounting rates as indicated by rates from both small and large rewards allows for the measurement of discount rates devoid of any effect of the magnitude of the reward. Because gender did not moderate any of our effects, we again included participant gender as a covariate in all analyses.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The mean of the seven AUDIT items was regressed on the RCI, the latent variable for discounting, and on gender. The latent variable for rates of discounting was regressed on the RCI and gender, and the covariance between gender and the RCI was estimated freely (see

Mindfulness refers to intentionally attending to current experiences in a nonjudgmental and accepting manner (
        Kabat-Zinn, 1990). Like religiousness, mindfulness is broadly associated with markers of mental and relational health (
        Brown &amp; Ryan, 2003; 
        Creswell, Way, Eisenberger, &amp; Lieberman, 2007; 
        Heppner et al., 2008).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">However, religiousness also differs from mindfulness. Religiousness involves specific beliefs, practices, and dedications, often in relation to a supernatural agent (
        Worthington et al., 2003). In contrast, mindfulness encourages enhanced awareness of present events and experience and does not involve a supernatural agent (
        Brown et al., 2007). Given these conceptual and experiential differences, between religiousness and mindfulness, we predict that the effect of religiousness on lower alcohol use would remain significant after controlling for mindfulness. Study 5 tested this hypothesis.

One estimate suggests that 68% of human beings would say that religion is important in their daily lives (
        Diener, Tay, &amp; Myers, 2011). A growing body of research has shown that religiousness relates to lower substance use (
        Benda et al., 2006; 
        Gartner et al., 1991; 
        Gorsuch, 1995;

        H. G. Koenig et al., 2001; 
        Koopmans et al., 1999; 
        Miller, 1998). Here, we provided a comprehensive test of the hypothesis that self-control represents one factor that helps explain why religiousness relates to lower substance (
        McCullough &amp; Willoughby, 2009).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Using diverse samples (college students and more general samples of adults; people from the United States and from four Asian nations) and methods (daily diary, cross-sectional, and longitudinal), seven studies supported this hypothesis. Study 1 showed that daily prayer had a lagged effect on daily alcohol use. Higher amounts of prayer predicted lower alcohol use on the subsequent day. Study 2 demonstrated that the cross-sectional relationship between religiousness and lower alcohol use was mediated by self-reported self-control. Study 3 replicated and extended these results using a behavioral self-control task, which enhances the validity of our findings. It showed that religiousness was associated cross-sectionally with both lower alcohol use and higher self-control on a delay discounting task, as indicated by expressing greater preferences for future monetary reward over immediate monetary rewards. As in Study 2, the relationship between religiousness and lower alcohol use appeared to be mediated by behavioral self-control. Study 4 replicated and extended the results of Studies 2 and 3 by showing that self-reported self-control mediated the effect of religiousness on changes in alcohol use over 6 weeks. Study 5 replicated the mediational pattern again with two-wave longitudinal data and showed that it remained significant after controlling for mindfulness. Thus, religiousness consistently predicted lower alcohol use, which was mediated by self-control.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Studies 6 and 7 replicated and extended these findings in two main ways. First, they extended 
        McCullough and Willoughby’s (2009) theorizing by showing that self-control mediated the relationship between religiousness and both alcohol use and drug use. By demonstrating self-control as a mediator of various health behaviors, these studies offered additional support for the proposition that religiousness can help reduce substance use generally through its relationship to higher self-control. Second, Studies 6 and 7 showed that self-control mediates the relationship between religiousness and lower substance use in diverse samples. Whereas our first five studies drew on largely Caucasian, American, highly educated samples, our final two studies used national samples of American and Asian adults. The fact that the mediating pattern replicated in these diverse samples suggests that self-control is a reliable mechanism underlying the association between religiousness and lower substance use. The consistency across these diverse samples is similar to previous research that has documented reliable relationships between religiousness and self-control across varied samples (see 
        McCullough &amp; Willoughby, 2009, p. 72). Thus, our findings provide a broad and novel demonstration of the reliability and validity of self-control as a mechanism underlying the association between religiousness and lower substance use.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">More broadly, the current investigation adds to a growing body of literature on the importance of understanding self-control processes within the context of religious beliefs and actions. For decades, some have argued that religion helps control people’s behavior in order to foster harmonious relationships (
        Durkheim, 1912/1965). However, controlling one’s behavior is not easy, and research indicates that it sometimes involves effortful regulation of one’s impulses (
        Baumeister, Bratslavsky, Muraven, &amp; Tice, 1998; 
        Schmeichel, Vohs, &amp; Baumeister, 2003; 
        Vohs &amp; Schmeichel, 2003). By understanding why religiousness is associated with lower substance use, the current investigation may help to explain how religion obtains some of its associations with other measures of health (
        McCullough &amp; Willoughby, 2009).
      </p><a id="psp-107-2-339-EBADA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Limitations and Future Directions</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The current studies provided consistent evidence that the well-established relationship between religiousness and lower substance use is mediated in part by self-control. Despite the consistency of these effects, some limitations may provide a springboard for future research.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">One limitation is that six of our seven samples were comprised of Americans, who live in a culture that may be more religious compared to other cultures. For example, 96% of Americans have reported believing in God, as have 68% of Germans, 72% of the British, 62% of the French, and 60% of the Dutch (
          Inglehart, Basáñez, Díez-Medrano, Halman, &amp; Luijkx, 2004). Therefore, one might argue that our results would not replicate in cultures marked by lower levels of religiousness. There are at least three reasons to doubt this possibility. First, the effects of religiousness on behavior are consistent across societies (e.g., 
          Bushman, Ridge, Das, Key, &amp; Busath, 2007; 
          Weeden &amp; Kurzban, 2013). Second, many religions, regardless of their popularity within or outside the United States, promote self-control among their followers, including the upkeep of one’s health through abstaining from unhealthy food and beverages. Third, we observed a similar mediating effect of self-control on lower substance use among Asians and Americans in Study 7.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">A second limitation is that we focused our investigation on a variety of health behaviors related to substance use. We did not, however, investigate a possible mediating role of self-control in helping understand previously documented associations between religiousness and better psychological well-being, lower mortality risk, and other types of social behavior. For example, re-analysis of data from one study (
          Welch, Tittle, &amp; Grasmick, 2006) suggested that self-control mediates the association of religiousness and lower levels of future criminal activity. Future research may examine whether self-control helps to explain part of why religious commitment is commonly associated with better health, well-being, and social behavior.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Another limitation lies in the strength of our mediating effects. Self-control reliably mediated the link between religiousness and lower substance use, but the size of its mediating effect was somewhat small. This is not surprising, given that mediating effects often fail to demonstrate large effect sizes (
          Preacher &amp; Kelley, 2011; 
          Shrout &amp; Bolger, 2002). Other factors may play a role in mediating the association. One such factor is monitoring. Recent work demonstrates that higher levels of religiousness relate to greater monitoring of oneself in relation to goal striving (self-monitoring) and greater belief that a higher power is monitoring one’s behavior (God monitoring), both of which in turn relate to more self-control (
          Carter, McCullough, &amp; Carver, 2012). Future research may explore whether self- and God-monitoring can help not only explain the relationship between religiousness and self-control, but also how self-control acts as a mechanism underlying lower substance use.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">A third limitation, which is not unique to this investigation, relates to our reliance on self-reported alcohol and drug use. Self-report measures of alcohol and drug use have demonstrated ample reliability and validity (
          Del Boca &amp; Darkes, 2003; 
          Harrison, 1997). However, it is possible that religious participants underreported their substance-use behavior as a means deflecting guilt, shame, or other negative emotions. Though sparse, existing evidence casts doubt on this possibility. For example, lower self-reports of cigarette use among religious individuals corresponds with their lower serum levels of the nicotine metabolite cotinine (
          Gillum, 2005; 
          Shin, 1996). In addition, the results from Study 4 showed that both the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between religiousness and lower alcohol use remained significant after controlling for social desirability. These findings contradict the alternative explanation that our results were due to a systematic bias in self-reports among highly religious participants.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">A potential avenue for future research may involve understanding the biological underpinnings of our effects. For example, future research may examine whether the mediating effect of self-control on religiousness and lower substance use is a product of shared environmental influences, shared genetic influences, or some combination of the two. Both religiousness and self-control have genetic bases (
          L. B. Koenig, McGue, Krueger, &amp; Bouchard, 2005; 
          Yamagata et al., 2005), but it is not clear how they operate to predict substance use. In addition, religious cognition may be associated with activation in regions associated with executive functioning (e.g., dorsolateral, ventromedial, and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex) when people are confronted with alcohol and drug-related stimuli, which may down-regulate activation in striatal reward circuits and may predict lower subsequent substance use (cf. 
          Brefczynski-Lewis, Lutz, Schaefer, Levinson, &amp; Davidson, 2007; 
          Gilman, Ramchandani, Davis, Bjork, &amp; Hommer, 2008).

Religious rituals and activities mirror self-control processes in multiple ways. They can be costly, effortful, and even painful, consuming much of one’s time and energy. However, religiousness and self-control also foster physical, mental, and relational well-being. By understanding the role of religiousness in promoting self-control, researchers will better understand why religiousness is reliably associated with lower substance use.</p><a id="psp-107-2-339-R" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_189" title="Footnotes">Footnotes</a></span><a id="fn1" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><sup>1</sup> Due to a technical error, 122 participants were missing demographic data on gender.
