A large multinational study revealed a widespread tendency for fused individuals to endorse making extreme sacrifices for their country. Nevertheless, when asked which of several groups they were most inclined to die for, most participants favored relatively small groups, such as family, over a large and extended group, such as country (Study 1). To integrate these findings, we proposed that a common mechanism accounts for the willingness of fused people to die for smaller and larger groups. Specifically, when fused people perceive that group members share core characteristics, they are more likely to project familial ties common in smaller groups onto the extended group, and this enhances willingness to fight and die for the larger group. Consistent with this, encouraging fused persons to focus on shared core characteristics of members of their country increased their endorsement of making extreme sacrifices for their country. This pattern emerged whether the core characteristics were biological (Studies 2 and 3) or psychological (Studies 4–6) and whether participants were from China, India, the United States, or Spain. Further, priming shared core values increased the perception of familial ties among fused group members, which, in turn, mediated the influence of fusion on endorsement of extreme sacrifices for the country (Study 5). Study 6 replicated this moderated mediation effect whether the core characteristics were positive or negative. Apparently, for strongly fused persons, recognizing that other group members share core characteristics makes extended groups seem “family like” and worth dying for.

          <i>Talking to the Enemy: Faith, Brotherhood, and the (Un)Making of Terrorists</i></blockquote></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Many people make personal sacrifices for their group, but precious few make the ultimate sacrifice. This is unsurprising, as the decision to sacrifice oneself defies the survival instinct, one of the most powerful of all human predispositions. What 
        <em>is</em> surprising is that there exist psychological forces that are so potent that they override people’s survival instinct. These powerful forces are the focus of this report. After 
        Atran (2010), we suggest that these forces consist of the perception of familial ties to other members of the group. Such perceptions emerge when people who have developed a visceral sense of oneness with a group—dubbed 
        <em>identity fusion</em>—feel that group members share core characteristics. The fusion process produces individuals who believe that their actions on the group’s behalf are not for faceless strangers but for “family.” We derived these hypotheses from identity fusion theory (
        Swann, Jetten, Gómez, Whitehouse, &amp; Bastian, 2012), a formulation that was recently developed to explain why people make extreme sacrifices for their group.
      </p><a id="psp-106-6-912-EJDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_7" title="Identity Fusion Theory">Identity Fusion Theory</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Identity fusion occurs when people experience a visceral sense of “oneness” with their group. This sense of oneness involves the union of personal identity (referring to idiosyncratic features of the individual) and social identity (referring to the alignment the individual has with a group). The union of the personal and social identities does not diminish the importance or impact of either one; instead, both sets of identities remain salient and agentic among fused persons. Moreover, the relational ties that fused persons form with other group members fuel their fusion with the group. Together, the agentic personal and social identities as well as relational ties fused persons have toward other group members predispose them to enact extreme sacrifices for the group.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">A growing literature has documented the capacity of measures of identity fusion to predict self-sacrifice for the group. For example, strongly fused persons are especially apt to endorse physically fighting and dying to defend their country from threats (
        Gómez, Brooks, et al., 2011; 
        Swann, Gómez, Seyle, Morales, &amp; Huici, 2009). In intergroup variations of moral dilemmas, strongly fused persons are particularly inclined to endorse committing suicide to save the lives of members of their country (
        Gómez, Brooks, et al., 2011; 
        Swann, Gómez, Dovidio, Hart, &amp; Jetten, 2010). Moreover, strongly fused persons respond to irrevocable ostracism by other group members by increasing their stated willingness to sacrifice themselves for the group (
        Gómez, Morales, Hart, Vázquez, &amp; Swann, 2011). In addition, when presented with an opportunity to donate to fellow Spaniards in need of financial help, strongly fused persons donated more personal funds than weakly fused persons (
        Swann, Gómez, Huici, Morales, &amp; Hixon, 2010). Finally, recent evidence suggests that fusion is most effective in predicting extreme, compared to relatively modest, sacrifices for the group (e.g., major rather than minor surgeries; 
        Swann et al., 2014).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Although previous theorists have developed constructs that resemble fusion in some ways (for a discussion, see 
        Swann et al., 2012), the closest intellectual cousin to fusion is “group identification” (e.g., 
        Ellemers, Spears, &amp; Doosje, 1997; 
        Postmes, Haslam, &amp; Jans, 2013). The group identification construct is based on social identity theorizing (
        Tajfel &amp; Turner, 1979). Although identification and fusion are similar in several respects, there are important differences between the two constructs. Consider the function of other group members. Social identity formulations hold that when the group is salient to an individual, other group members are principally recognized for their capacity to carry information regarding the values and norms of the group. As such, group members are bound to one another through 
        <em>collective</em> ties that are based on the degree to which members embody the prototypic qualities of the group rather than the unique relationships they establish with one another. In contrast, fusion theory holds that even when the group is salient, its members recognize and appreciate the unique relationships they form with fellow group members, much as family members do. Fused persons may thus form strong 
        <em>familial or relational ties</em> to other group members as well as 
        <em>collective</em> ties to the group category (
        Brewer &amp; Gardner, 1996; 
        Caporael, 2001; for a discussion, see 
        Swann et al., 2012).
        <a id="b-fn1"> </a><sup /></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In small groups, it is easy to understand how fused persons form familial as well as collective ties to fellow group members, as such groups afford ample opportunity for members to develop close relationships with one another. Members of larger groups, however, may develop personal relationships with only a small proportion of the members of the group. How then, do people who are fused with large groups come to perceive that they have familial ties with 
        <em>all</em> group members? One potential answer to this question may come from examining the distinction between local and extended fusion.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Local fusion typically emerges in relatively small groups such as families, tribal units, and small bands of teammates or soldiers. Members of such groups typically share important “core” characteristics, most notably genes and values. For fused persons, knowing that these core characteristics are shared may reinforce the perception of familial ties to fellow group members, ties that encourage them to make extreme sacrifices for the group.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In contrast, extended fusion emerges in relatively large groups. Examples include countries (e.g., 
        Gómez, Brooks, et al., 2011; 
        Swann et al., 2009) and political parties (
        Buhrmester et al., 2012). Even though it is impossible to form 
        <em>actual</em> familial ties to all other members of large groups, under the proper conditions fused persons may 
        <em>project</em> familial ties onto them. This projection process may be set in motion by priming shared characteristics of the group members. Priming shared core characteristics may foster the perception of oneness within the group, which should, in turn, encourage the perception of familial ties toward other group members. These perceptions may then encourage persons who are fused with large groups to endorse dying for their group. This reasoning is consistent with the common assertion that the perception of familial ties to other group members is often a precursor of endorsement of extreme behavior for the group (e.g., 
        Atran, 2010; 
        Junger, 2010).
      </p><a id="psp-106-6-912-EIDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_15" title="Triggering the Projection Process by Priming Shared Core Characteristics">Triggering the Projection Process by Priming Shared Core Characteristics</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Group members may share characteristics that are biological (e.g., genes) as well as socially acquired (e.g., values). The perception of shared 
        <em>biological</em> characteristics may be compelling due to a widespread belief that biological qualities of people reflect their real, underlying nature or “essence” (e.g., 
        Hirschfeld, 1996, 
        2001; 
        Medin, 1989; 
        Medin &amp; Ortony, 1989). Within a shared essence framework, “ingroups” and “outgroups” are presumed to resemble natural kinds (
        Rothbart &amp; Taylor, 1992), especially when these natural kinds are sharply defined (
        McGarty, Haslam, Hutchinson, &amp; Grace, 1995; 
        Yzerbyt, Rocher, &amp; Schadron, 1997) or organized around endogamy and descent (
        Gil-White, 2001). Recently, researchers have shown that it is possible to activate such biological essentialist thinking toward ingroup members by priming people’s beliefs in the genetic determinants of race (
        Williams &amp; Eberhardt, 2008). A parallel argument can be made with respect to the consequences of activating socially acquired characteristics. Indeed, many of the same arguments that have been made regarding biological essentialism have also been made with respect to 
        <em>social</em> essentialism (e.g., 
        Morton, Postmes, Haslam, &amp; Hornsey, 2009; 
        Rangel &amp; Keller, 2011). Although social essentialism has focused on qualities that people acquire by virtue of birth (e.g., social class), here we extend this logic to qualities that are acquired later in life (e.g., values).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Past research has indicated that priming people’s beliefs that group members share core characteristics will encourage them to perceive that the group itself is meaningful in defining the self (
        Simon, Hastedt, &amp; Aufderheide, 1997; see also 
        Brewer, 1993; 
        Rubin &amp; Badea, 2012; 
        Simon, 1992). For strongly fused group members, priming shared core characteristics will do more than this. That is, strongly fused persons perceive other group members not just in terms of their shared group membership, but also in relational terms. Exposure to a shared characteristics prime may strengthen shared identity perceptions but also encourage the fused individual to see the group as composed of individuals who have a uniform, clearly defined “essence” that is common among family members. Moreover, this shift to seeing group members in familial rather than merely relational terms will embolden extreme pro-group behavior, as group members are now family members whom it is the duty of the fused person to support and protect (for a discussion of the link between duty and family ties, see 
        Fuligni &amp; Pedersen, 2002). This reasoning suggests a moderated mediation hypothesis wherein perceptions of familial ties mediate the interactive impact of fusion and shared core characteristics on endorsement of self-sacrifice for the group.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Our analysis of the likely impact of the perception of shared core characteristics has one further implication. If it is the perception of 
        <em>sharing</em> core characteristics with other group members that makes group membership especially meaningful for fused persons, then the precise basis of this sense of sharing and communality should not matter. More specifically, whether the core characteristics are negative or positive, priming them should promote the perception of familial ties and endorsement of self-sacrifice.

We employed a mix of methodologies, including a large international survey, experimental designs, and mediational analyses. We began by attempting to replicate, in six continents, earlier evidence from Europe and North America that strongly fused participants were especially inclined to endorse dying for their country. We then asked if, when given a choice, participants would be more willing to die for groups involving local fusion (e.g., families) rather than groups involving extended fusion (e.g., country). Five experiments then examined the causal role of perceptions of shared characteristics on endorsement of extreme behavior for the group. In all five studies, we expected that fused persons would be especially inclined to endorse dying for the group when encouraged to ponder the biological (genes; Studies 2–3) or psychological characteristics (core values; Studies 4–6) that group members share. We also tested the notion that perception of familial ties to the group would mediate the impact of priming shared core values on the tendency for fused persons to endorse self-sacrifice (Study 5), even when the shared core values were negative (Study 6).</p><a id="psp-106-6-912-EGDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_23" title="Study 1: Identity Fusion and Endorsement of Extreme Sacrifice for Country and Family in Six Continents">Study 1: Identity Fusion and Endorsement of Extreme Sacrifice for Country and Family in Six Continents</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Study 1 was designed to replicate, in an international sample, earlier evidence of a tendency for fused persons to endorse sacrificing their lives for their country (for a review, see

First, the positive associations between identity fusion with country and endorsement of extreme behavior for one’s country were replicated in samples from six continents and 11 countries. Second, when given a chance to endorse dying for several different groups, participants in all of the countries we sampled were especially inclined to die for small groups in general and family in particular, testifying to the psychological allure of the familial ties present in small groups. Third, there was considerable variability in the strength of the relationship between fusion with country and endorsement of extreme behavior for country. Apparently, fusion does not automatically trigger endorsement of extreme behavior for large groups. Instead, moderator and mediator variables may influence the strength of the relationship between fusion with country and endorsement of extreme sacrifice for country.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The remaining studies in this article were designed to pinpoint these moderators and mediators. In general, we assumed that people would sacrifice themselves for large groups insofar as they are able to project familial ties onto such groups. This projection process will be facilitated when fused persons focus on shared core characteristics of the group, which, in turn, encourage them to impute familial ties to the group.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Specifically, we predict that among fused persons, the perception of shared core values should enhance perception of familial ties and perception of familial ties should predict increased willingness to fight and die for the group. We explore the moderation hypotheses in Studies 2–6 and add the mediating role of perception of familial ties in Studies 5 and 6.

            Hayes, 2013, Model 8). As can be seen in 
            Table 3, shared core values moderated the effect of identity fusion on familial ties as well as the direct effect of identity fusion on endorsement of extreme actions for Spain (controlling for familial ties). Providing evidence for moderated mediation, the index of moderated mediation was significant (

          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Consistent with the results of Studies 2–4, Study 5 supports the notion that priming beliefs regarding shared core characteristics of group members increases the tendency for fused persons to endorse fighting and dying for a large, collective group. Furthermore, the results indicate that the tendency for familial ties to mediate the impact of fusion on endorsement of extreme sacrifice for the group was stronger in the shared-values condition compared to the non-shared values condition.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">With such evidence of the moderators and mediators of the impact of fusion on endorsement of extreme pro-group behavior in hand, we probed further into the precise mechanisms underlying our findings. First, in Studies 2–5 it seems likely that participants believed that the characteristics that group members shared were positive (i.e., good genes or positive core values). This leaves open the possibility that our effects may be limited to instances in which 
            <em>positive</em> shared core characteristics are activated. That is, it might be the case that priming shared core characteristics enhanced endorsement of extreme behavior among fused persons not because the characteristics were shared but because they were positive. To test this rival explanation, we examined whether the effects of shared characteristics would generalize to negative as well as positive core values. In Study 6, we assessed the impact of both types of shared core values.
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">A second ambiguity associated with the results of Study 5 pertains to the evidence that the perception of familial ties mediated the interactive effects of fusion and core values on endorsement of extreme behavior. Although our findings revealed evidence of 
            <em>statistical</em> mediation, the fact that our measures were collected in the same session weakens the case for true mediation. To strengthen the evidentiary basis for our argument, in Study 6 we measured fusion 6 months prior to the experiment.

In the first wave, 133 students completed the verbal fusion scale (
            Gómez, Brooks, et al., 2011; α = .81). Six months later, 111 participants completed the second wave (63 females, 
            <em>M</em>age = 37.05, 
            <em>SD</em> = 11.11) in which they were randomly assigned to the two manipulations (core values and valence of value) and then completed the outcome measures. Attrition was unrelated to fusion scores,

          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The procedure followed the one used in Study 5 except for one key change. Specifically, in addition to manipulating perceptions of the degree to which Spaniards shared core values, we also manipulated the valence of the values (positive vs. negative). Participants learned that a study had been conducted with a representative sample of Spaniards regarding the core values shared by Spaniards. The experimenter then randomly assigned them to one level of shared core values (shared core values vs. non-shared core values) and one level of valence (negative vs. positive). That is, participants in the 
            <em>shared values</em> conditions learned that there was high agreement (75%) regarding the characteristic or core value that most Spaniards shared, while those in the 
            <em>non-shared values</em> conditions learned that there was low agreement (25%). Similarly, the valence manipulation consisted of informing participants that the core values were either negative or positive (
            <em>negative vs. positive core value</em> conditions, respectively). In all conditions, the content of the values was not divulged.
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The instructions explained that one of the goals of the research was to determine how well participants could guess the core values under investigation. After reading the article, participants guessed what the core value was and wrote it down to reinforce the manipulation. Representative examples of negative core values included conformist, lazy, and corrupt; positive core values included sociable, cheerful, and friendly.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">As manipulation checks, participants indicated the percentage of Spaniards they thought shared the core value as well as the positivity of the core value on scales ranging from −3 (
            <em>strongly negative</em>) to 3 (
            <em>strongly positive</em>). A pair of regressions on these manipulation checks was conducted. In each regression, the predictors were fusion, shared core values, valence, all two-way interactions, and the triple interaction.

First, as in Study 5, the effect of identity fusion on extreme pro-group behavior was mediated via familial ties, and this mediated effect was more pronounced when shared core characteristics were primed. The case for mediation was further bolstered by the fact that we used a prospective design in which fusion was measured 6 months prior to the experiment and the manipulation of shared core values occurred before the measures of perceived familial ties and endorsement of extreme behaviors. In addition, this design provides evidence that at least in some instances, fusion predicts perceived familial ties, a relationship that may theoretically unfold in the opposite direction in naturally occurring settings. Second, our effects generalized across negative as well as positive shared core values. This finding indicates that our effects were driven by the degree to which the core values were shared, rather than the degree to which they were positive.</p><a id="psp-106-6-912-EADA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_127" title="General Discussion">General Discussion</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">What makes a group worth dying for? We began by examining the generality of the tendency for fused persons to endorse fighting and dying for a large group—their country. Participants from six continents endorsed fighting and dying for their country insofar as they were fused with it (Study 1). Further analysis revealed an intriguing twist, however. When asked which of several groups they were most inclined to die for, participants overwhelmingly favored relatively small groups, especially their immediate family. We accordingly shifted our attention to a new question: Why might fused persons be more inclined to die for smaller than larger groups?</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We proposed that the special allure of small groups is that people feel strongly bonded to “family like” units whose members share characteristics with each other. This suggests that encouraging fused people to focus on the shared characteristics of group members should increase their willingness to endorse extreme behavior for large groups. Our findings supported this hypothesis. Specifically, activating the perception of shared core characteristics increased endorsement of fighting and dying for the group among fused persons. This pattern emerged whether the shared characteristics were biological (genes; Studies 2 and 3) or psychological (core values; Studies 4–6) and whether the participants were from China, India, America, or Spain.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Having demonstrated the power of the perception of shared core characteristics on endorsement of extreme pro-group actions among fused persons, we sought to identify the mechanism underlying this relationship. We hypothesized that priming shared characteristics among fused group members might foster the perception of oneness and intimacy within the group, which should, in turn, cause them to perceive familial ties to other group members. These perceptions might, in turn, promote endorsement of self-sacrifice for the group. The results of Study 5 provided evidence for the mediational role of perception of familial ties.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The results of Study 6 provided further and more convincing evidence for the mediational role of perceived familial ties due to the use of a prospective design. Furthermore, support for our hypotheses emerged whether the shared core values were positive or negative. The latter data ruled out the rival notion that shared core values appeal to fused persons because sharing positive genes or positive values enhances the positivity of the group and hence the willingness to make sacrifices for the group. Instead, it appears that, regardless of positivity, recognizing that other group members share common core characteristics fosters the perception of familial ties with other group members, and these perceptions persuade the person that the group is worth dying for.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Our effects also generalized across gender. That is, in no study did gender interact with our manipulations. The only significant gender effect was that males were more inclined to endorse extreme behaviors than women, but this effect emerged in Studies 1 and 4 only. These results are consistent with past work showing that men compared to women tend to be more physically aggressive (
        Eagly &amp; Steffen, 1986) and are more likely to rescue others in emergency situations (

          Ellemers et al., 1997; 
          Tajfel &amp; Turner, 1979) provided novel insights into group processes by illuminating the importance of social identities and collective ties to the group, as well as the implications of these allegiances for inter-group dynamics. While highlighting these processes, social identity approaches downplayed the importance of the complementary processes, namely, personal identities, perception of familial ties, and the implications of these processes for intra-group dynamics. The latter processes are the focus of identity fusion theory. From this vantage point, our formulation is part of the recent emphasis in the literature on illuminating aspects of group processes that were excluded from the original versions of social identity theory and self-categorization theory (see also 
          Caporael, 2001; 
          Postmes &amp; Jetten, 2006; 
          Prentice, 2001; 
          Roccas &amp; Brewer, 2002; 
          Smith, Coats, &amp; Murphy, 2001).
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Our findings complement past investigations of identity fusion in several ways. Based on the assumption that identity fusion serves to poise people for action on behalf of the group, past research identified several variables that induce people to actually enact pro-group actions. For example, in several studies, increasing the salience of either the 
          <em>social</em> or 
          <em>personal</em> identities of strongly fused participants increased endorsement of pro-group action (
          Gómez, Brooks, et al., 2011; 
          Swann et al., 2009). Moreover, increasing physiological arousal through exercise increased personal agency, which in turn promoted endorsement of dying for the group and other pro-group actions among highly fused persons (
          Swann, Gómez, Huici, et al., 2010). Furthermore, emotional engagement with the group mediates the effects of identity fusion on endorsement of sacrificing oneself for the group (
          Swann et al., in press).
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Here, we shifted focus onto 
          <em>characteristics of the group</em> that encourage highly fused persons to engage in pro-group behavior. For leads, we turned first to the psychological essentialism literature. This work grew up around the proposition that people understand some objects and categories as having relatively deep essences that define those objects and categories (
          Medin &amp; Ortony, 1989). Combining this with research on group entitativity and group homogeneity, we reasoned that for group members, the perception of shared essential qualities with others would encourage the belief that the group was more intimate and meaningful, much like a family unit (see also 
          Brewer, 1993; 
          Rubin &amp; Badea, 2012; 
          Simon, 1992). So convinced, fused group members would develop particularly strong perceptions of familial ties to the group and these ties would, in turn, amplify willingness to make extreme sacrifices for the group.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Support for this analysis came from evidence that priming the perception that members of the group shared core characteristics increased the tendency for highly fused individuals to endorse pro-group action. Furthermore, two studies (Studies 5 and 6) suggested that this effect was mediated by the perception of familial ties to other group members. Apparently, for fused persons, recognizing that group members share numerous core characteristics with one another activates the projection of familial ties to fellow group members. The experience of such ties convinces fused group members that the group is worth dying for.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">One intriguing issue concerns 
          <em>how</em> perceptions of familial ties mediate the link between fusion and endorsement of extreme sacrifice. One possibility is that familial ties carry with them a sense of duty or obligation that compels fused persons to rush to the assistance of “family members” when they are imperiled. A related possibility is that perceptions of familial ties intensify the perceptions of oneness that fused people enjoy with other group members, and these feelings encourage them to believe that they will live on through their fellow group members. This latter point and the contribution of perceptions of familial ties to the willingness of fused persons to endorse self-sacrifice for the group are generally consistent with an evolutionary perspective on the psychology of self-sacrifice. Evolutionary psychologists have argued that a kin-detection system regulates the decision to sacrifice the self (
          Alvergne, Faurie, &amp; Raymond, 2009; 
          Lieberman, Tooby, &amp; Cosmides, 2007). This framework is clearly compatible with the tendency for participants in Study 1 to express more willingness to sacrifice themselves for members of small groups of immediate family members (local fusion) than larger aggregates (extended fusion). It is also consistent with our evidence that priming the shared genetic qualities of the group in Studies 2 and 3 amplified the willingness of fused persons to die for the group. Furthermore, the results of Studies 4–6 suggest that for fused persons, the perception of shared core values psychologically transforms a large impersonal group into a relatively small, family like group. This transformation, in turn, triggers the perception of familial ties, which in turn heightens endorsement of extreme behavior for the group.
        </p><a id="psp-106-6-912-EAADA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Conclusions</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Whether they are soldiers, terrorists, or gang members, those who engage in mortal combat for their group typically attribute the sacrifices they make to devotion to a “brotherhood” or “sisterhood” (
          Atran, 2010; 
          Junger, 2010). Such explanations are eminently plausible when people are quite familiar with the persons for whom they make sacrifices. Nevertheless, the “brotherhood” idea becomes strained when group members do not know all members of the group for whom they sacrifice themselves. Our findings point to a psychological pathway through which large aggregates of strangers are transformed into “family members” for whom some individuals will make extreme sacrifices. The key, it appears, is the perception that the members of the group share certain core characteristics that make them akin to family. More specifically, for fused persons, the perception of shared core characteristics fosters perceptions of familial ties to other group members, which, in turn, embolden endorsement of self-sacrifice. From this perspective, what appears to be “selfless” behavior on the part of fused persons is not selfless at all. Rather, when fused persons endorse sacrifice for other group members, they do so out of a sense of personal obligation to individuals whom they construe to be living extensions of themselves, their family.

          Swann et al., 2012), identification effects were always weaker than fusion effects and never qualified the effects of fusion. Because this was also true in these studies, we deleted identification from the analyses that we report here. Nevertheless, the relevant analyses are available upon request from the first author.
