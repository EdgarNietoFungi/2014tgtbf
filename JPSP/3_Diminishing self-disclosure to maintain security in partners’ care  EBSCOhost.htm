Perceivers who strongly valued relationships with targets reported high levels of global self-disclosure, consistent with many findings suggesting salutary effects of disclosure. However, these same perceivers reported low self-disclosure of needs and desires in hypothetical (Study 1) and actual (Study 2) situations characterized by targets’ unresponsive behavior. Similarly, in daily report (Study 3) and behavioral observation (Study 4) studies, perceivers who valued relationships with targets perceived high levels of self-disclosure when targets were responsive, but they perceived low self-disclosure when targets were unresponsive, and these perceptions seemed partly illusory. In turn, these perceptions of low self-disclosure in situations characterized by partners’ unresponsive behavior predicted decreased perceptions of diagnosticity of targets’ behavior (Studies 1–3) and buffered the negative affective and interpersonal effects of unresponsive behavior (Study 4). Experimental manipulations (Studies 5 and 6) demonstrated the motivational nature of perceived self-disclosure. Collectively, the results suggest that a desire to bond with targets motivates perceivers to downplay the diagnosticity of targets’ unresponsive behavior through diminishing their self-disclosure, in turn preserving perceivers’ trust in targets’ care and commitment.

        Clark &amp; Lemay, 2010; 
        Holmes &amp; Rempel, 1989; 
        Reis, Clark, &amp; Holmes, 2004). This trust facilitates the development of intimacy (
        Laurenceau, Barrett, &amp; Pietromonaco, 1998; 
        Reis &amp; Shaver, 1988), bolsters relationship satisfaction (
        Lemay, Clark, &amp; Feeney, 2007; 
        Murray, Holmes, &amp; Griffin, 2000), motivates accommodating responses to interpersonal difficulties (
        Murray, Bellavia, Rose, &amp; Griffin, 2003; 
        Shallcross &amp; Simpson, 2012; 
        Wieselquist, Rusbult, Foster, &amp; Agnew, 1999), and improves the likelihood of relationship persistence (
        Arriaga, Reed, Goodfriend, &amp; Agnew, 2006; 
        Downey, Freitas, Michaelis, &amp; Khouri, 1998).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Where does this trust come from? Theorizing on interpersonal trust suggests that perceivers’ trust is based on their repeated observations of target partners’ behavior in diagnostic situations—situations in which partners’ behavior is thought to be indicative of their sentiments toward perceivers (
        Holmes &amp; Rempel, 1989; 
        Kelley et al., 2003; 
        Shallcross &amp; Simpson, 2012; 
        Simpson, 2007a, 
        2007b). Although the conceptualizations of these situations vary, self-disclosure (i.e., the expression of information about the self) of needs and desires may be an important feature of diagnostic situations. That is, perceivers may view situations as more diagnostic of partners’ relationship motivations when they have disclosed needs or desires to their partners, relative to situations in which they have not disclosed. When perceivers have disclosed needs or desires, they have the ability to gauge their partners’ motivation to respond to those needs and desires, and these observations could impact perceivers’ trust.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">But is trust so serendipitous, so dependent on the information gleaned from these weighty interactions? Are perceivers helpless victims (or beneficiaries) of diagnostic situations and the messages they convey? Or perhaps is diagnosticity itself in the eye of the beholder? In the current research, we test the prediction that perceivers selectively perceive diagnosticity, including whether they have disclosed their needs and desires to partners, in a manner that supports desired conclusions regarding partners’ care and commitment. In our view, people are not passive observers of diagnostic situations. Rather, the perceived diagnosticity of situations, like most interpersonal cognitions, can be driven by perceivers’ goals.</p><a id="psp-106-1-37-EKDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_8" title="Self-Disclosure and Situational Diagnosticity">Self-Disclosure and Situational Diagnosticity</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We propose that perceivers are more likely to perceive partners’ behaviors as diagnostic of partners’ relationship sentiments and motivations when perceivers believe they have disclosed their needs and desires to partners. The perception of this self-disclosure may contribute to their belief that partners were aware of an opportunity to respond in a supportive or otherwise prorelationship manner, which narrows the range of attributions for partners’ unresponsive behavior. That is, when partners behave in a cold, selfish, or neglectful manner, the perception that one disclosed needs and desires reduces the perceived likelihood that partners’ behavior was due to partners’ lack of awareness, increasing the likelihood that perceivers interpret this behavior as the result of partners’ lack of care, lack of commitment, or unwillingness to sacrifice for the self and relationship. In contrast, when perceivers believe they have not communicated their needs and desires to partners, lack of awareness may be a viable explanation of partners’ negative behaviors. Hence, people may often use the clarity of their own self-disclosure of needs and desires as a way of discerning whether situations should be considered diagnostic of partners’ sentiments.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">A number of findings are consistent with our argument that self-disclosure serves as a source of information regarding situational diagnosticity. When needs for support arise, people tend to express those needs to their partners, and this expression tends to elicit support provision from their partners (
        Clark &amp; Lemay, 2010; 
        Collins &amp; Feeney, 2000; 
        Laurenceau et al., 1998). Moreover, people often use self-disclosure to build close relationships (
        Derlega &amp; Grzelak, 1979; 
        Omarzu, 2000). These findings suggest that people know that disclosure sometimes elicits responsiveness, especially from partners who value and care for them. On the other hand, by revealing potentially negative information or vulnerabilities that could be exploited, disclosure also increases the risk of rejection and loss of power, and people also seem to be aware of this risk (
        Baxter &amp; Montgomery, 1996; 
        Kelly &amp; McKillop, 1996). For instance, people with a high need for approval (
        Brundage, Derlega, &amp; Cash, 1976) and who perceive a high risk of rejection (
        Omarzu, 2000) are reluctant to disclose personal information about themselves, and people seem to calibrate their self-disclosure of emotion with their confidence in their partner’s care, taking the risk of revealing emotional vulnerabilities only to the extent that they are confident that this disclosure will not be met with rejection (
        Lemay &amp; Clark, 2008). Hence, people do seem to be aware that self-disclosure can create a situation that reveals the partner’s sentiments toward the self and relationship, whether positive or negative.
      </p><a id="psp-106-1-37-EJDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_12" title="Motivated Perceptions of Lack of Disclosure">Motivated Perceptions of Lack of Disclosure</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">When people desire to maintain a close, communal relationship with a particular partner, as indicated by strong relationship commitment (
        Rusbult &amp; Buunk, 1993) and care for the partner’s welfare (
        Mills, Clark, Ford, &amp; Johnson, 2004), they usually want the partner to reciprocate these sentiments (
        Holmes &amp; Rempel, 1989). Indeed, care for partners’ welfare coincides with interest in partners’ reciprocating care (
        Clark, Dubash, &amp; Mills, 1998), and commitment is dependent on partners exhibiting signs of reciprocated commitment (
        Wieselquist et al., 1999). Perceiving such reciprocation may satisfy evolved needs to forge stable bonds characterized by mutual care (
        Baumeister &amp; Leary, 1995). As these relationships depend on the motivation of both partners (
        Attridge, Berscheid, &amp; Simpson, 1995; 
        Drigotas, Rusbult, &amp; Verette, 1999), events that signal partners’ lack of care or commitment may threaten perceivers’ goals to maintain these relationships. Moreover, perceivers’ commitment and care toward a partner reflect dependence on the relationship and heighten their feelings of vulnerability to emotional pain and more tangible losses when they are confronted with the threat of abandonment or mistreatment by the partner (
        Lemay, Overall, &amp; Clark, 2012; 
        Murray, Holmes, &amp; Collins, 2006; 
        Wieselquist et al., 1999). People engage in a variety of strategies to reduce these feelings of vulnerability (see 
        Murray et al., 2006). For instance, they may engage in prorelationship behaviors that make partners feel similarly dependent on the relationship, which may restore power imbalances and reduce the perceived likelihood of rejection (
        Murray et al., 2009). Alternatively, they may withdraw their psychological investment in the relationship and devalue their partner as a source of connection, which could also restore power imbalances and reduce the sting of anticipated rejection (
        Murray et al., 2000).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Most relevant to the current research, people may regulate their feelings of vulnerability through the use of motivated cognitive strategies that govern the appraisal of situations and interpretation of partners’ behaviors (see 
        Murray et al., 2006). For instance, people who protect themselves from the threat of rejection by reducing dependence and devaluing the partner may interpret the partner’s behaviors in negative ways that facilitate and justify this distancing decision, whereas people who decide to manage feelings of vulnerability by seeking greater connection with the partner may interpret the same behavior in positive ways that provide reassurance regarding the partner’s trustworthiness and therefore motivate and justify continued dependence (see 
        Murray et al., 2006).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">These cognitive strategies may target perceptions of situational diagnosticity. Strategies involving reduction of dependence on the partner may involve perceiving cold, neglectful, or selfish behaviors as especially diagnostic of the partner’s underlying sentiments and motivations. Strategies that involve maintaining connection and trust may instead include perceiving such unresponsive behaviors as irrelevant to the partner’s true feelings and relationship motives, which would help justify a decision to maintain connection. Of course, motivated perceivers could also try to regulate trust by altering their views of whether partners behaved in unresponsive ways, and some findings suggest that people do have biased perceptions (
        Lemay &amp; Clark, 2008; 
        Lemay et al., 2007) and memories (
        Lemay &amp; Neal, 2013) of partners’ responsiveness. However, the presence of unresponsive behavior may sometimes be so clear that the occurrence of the behavior is undeniable, requiring perceivers to rely on other strategies to facilitate their connection goals, such as redefining the situation. Under these conditions, altering perceptions of situational diagnosticity may be a commonly used method of reaching the desired conclusion that the partner still cares for the self and relationship.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">However, motivation does not have an unfettered influence over cognitive process (otherwise people would never experience undesired cognitions). Perceivers’ ability to reach desired conclusions is constrained by their ability to construct seemingly reasonable justifications for those conclusions (
        Kunda, 1990). This constraint may be relevant to perceivers’ attempts at redefining situations. Perceivers would likely have nagging doubts about their own objectivity if they were to deny the diagnosticity of partners’ unresponsive behavior without a seemingly rational justification. To achieve a sense of conviction in the conclusion that unresponsive behaviors are nondiagnostic, they must be able to point to seemingly supportive evidence. We expect that perceivers often underestimate their own self-disclosure of needs and desires as a way of supporting the claim that partners’ behaviors lack diagnosticity.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">For a number of reasons, this strategy may be especially compelling. First, this strategy depends on a judgment regarding own behavior (whether one clearly communicated needs and desires to partners). Judgments regarding one’s own behavior tend to be made with less accuracy and clarity than judgments of one’s own internal states or others’ behavior (
        Andersen, Glassman, &amp; Gold, 1998; 
        Vazire, 2010), and this may indicate greater leeway for cognitive distortion of perceivers’ own behavior relative to other strategies, such as those that involve altering perceptions of the behaviors enacted by partners. Second, insufficient disclosure may be argued on the basis of asymmetries in information regarding needs and desires conveyed to partners versus information that is privately experienced. Given that people do not usually express every nuance of their internal experiences, they may easily generate counterfactual thoughts regarding the information that would have elicited partners’ responsiveness, if only it were conveyed (e.g., “I should have expressed how important it was to me”). Third, attributing partners’ unresponsive behavior to perceivers’ own lack of disclosure shifts the responsibility for partners’ unresponsive behavior from partners to perceivers, leaving intact perceivers’ sense of control regarding partners’ responsiveness in future interactions (i.e., next time, if I more clearly disclose my needs, my partner will be responsive) and circumventing potentially destructive feelings of anger (
        Lemay et al., 2012; 
        Quigley &amp; Tedeschi, 1996; 
        Weiner, Graham, &amp; Chandler, 1982).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Perceivers’ chronic relationship motives may determine the use of these strategies. Strong desires to maintain bonds may shift the perceived utility of the available risk-regulation strategies, such that strategies that manage vulnerability by bolstering connection and security, including underestimating disclosure of needs and desires in the face of partners’ unresponsive behavior, are preferred over strategies that manage vulnerability by reducing dependence on the partner. This prediction is consistent with interdependence theoretical perspectives on motivated interpersonal cognition. According to interdependence theory, people who strongly want to maintain close relationships (i.e., people who are high in commitment) are motivated to defend their relationships from threat (
        Rusbult &amp; Van Lange, 1996; 
        Thibaut &amp; Kelley, 1959). Consistent with this framework, highly committed individuals perceive their relationships as superior to others’ relationships (
        Rusbult, Lange, Wildschut, Yovetich, &amp; Verette, 2000), and they devalue alternative romantic partners (
        Johnson &amp; Rusbult, 1989), both of which can maintain their feelings of commitment. Moreover, these commitment-enhancing perceptions are strengthened when perceivers are under threat, suggesting that they reflect motivated processes (
        Johnson &amp; Rusbult, 1989; 
        Rusbult et al., 2000). Similarly, individuals who care for their partners’ welfare tend to perceive their partners as similarly caring in return, even when this does not reflect partners’ true sentiments (
        Lemay &amp; Clark, 2008; 
        Lemay et al., 2007). Research examining positive illusions in relationships (
        Murray, Holmes, &amp; Griffin, 1996a, 
        1996b) similarly suggests that people view their partners in ways that are consistent with their romantic ideals to justify their own commitment and that these illusions can enhance relationship quality for both partners. Research on motivated inaccuracy in close relationships also suggests that people are inaccurate at reading their partners’ minds when inaccuracy protects them from recognizing threatening information and that this process promotes relationship longevity (
        Ickes &amp; Simpson, 2003; 
        Simpson, Ickes, &amp; Blackstone, 1995).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Hence, in the current research, we expect that motivated perceivers exhibit a bias in which they underestimate their own self-disclosure in unresponsive situations—situations in which partners behave (or are perceived to behave) in a cold, selfish, or neglectful manner. That is, perceivers who strongly value targets should perceive less disclosure of their needs and desires following targets’ unresponsive behavior relative to other situations (i.e., situations in which the partner does not behave in an unresponsive manner), and comparison of disclosure perceptions to external indicators of perceivers’ disclosure should suggest that perceivers underestimate their disclosure in these unresponsive situations. In turn, underestimating disclosure should facilitate the conclusion that partners’ behavior is not diagnostic of their sentiments. In other words, motivated perceivers may exhibit a backward logic (backward relative to the logic implied in most theorizing on trust) in which they judge situations as diagnostic based on their implications for trust. They see situations are diagnostic, and as characterized by the self-disclosure of needs and desires that makes them so, when partners behave in a caring or otherwise pro-relationship manner, but they claim inadequate disclosure to see situations as nondiagnostic when partners behave in unresponsive ways that could undermine trust. In addition to being consistent with research on biased judgments of interpersonal relationships, this prediction coincides with research on diagnosticity biases, which suggests that people see events as conveying desired information (
        Vorauer &amp; Ross, 1993) and with general research on motivated reasoning, which suggests that people construct biased impressions, beliefs, and evaluations that support desired conclusions (
        Kunda, 1990). Hence, it seems plausible that motivations to maintain relationships with targets can bias perceptions of self-disclosure, as these perceptions could support the desired conclusion that targets’ unresponsive behavior is not diagnostic, which could protect trust and maintain interdependence.
      </p><a id="psp-106-1-37-EIDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_21" title="Relation to Other Theoretical Views on Self-Disclosure">Relation to Other Theoretical Views on Self-Disclosure</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Our prediction that perceivers who most value relationships wish to see lack of self-disclosure in some situations contradicts most theoretical frameworks involving self-disclosure, which posit that disclosure has positive interpersonal consequences and plays a key role in the maintenance of relationships. For instance, 
        Reis and Shaver’s (1988) model of intimacy proposes that intimacy develops through a process of disclosing important information about the self to a partner and then receiving a responsive response. Similarly, social penetration theory (
        Altman &amp; Taylor, 1973) proposes that relationship closeness involves increases in the depth of self-disclosure. A number of findings support these views. Self-disclosure has a consistent positive association with relationship evaluations (e.g., 
        Finkenauer, Engels, Branje, &amp; Meeus, 2004; 
        Finkenauer &amp; Righetti, 2011; 
        Hendrick, 1981; 
        Hendrick, Hendrick, &amp; Adler, 1988; 
        Laurenceau et al., 1998; 
        Meeks, Hendrick, &amp; Hendrick, 1998; 
        Pollmann &amp; Finkenauer, 2009). Moreover, meta-analyses on self-disclosure suggest that intimate disclosures enhance attraction between disclosers and listeners (
        Collins &amp; Miller, 1994). From this point of view, people who want relationships should hardly feel threatened by the perception of self-disclosure. To the contrary, their perception of disclosure may even be desired and reassuring.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We do not dispute that self-disclosure often has benefits. However, we believe that a more nuanced approach can reveal the situational factors that shape the meaning and consequences of disclosure. None of the findings described above examined perceptions of self-disclosure of needs and desires in situations characterized by the partner’s lack of responsiveness. Hence, none of the findings examined the potentially threatening consequence (i.e., perceived diagnosticity of unresponsive behaviors) of perceived self-disclosure that we have emphasized. Indeed, most of the studies concluding that disclosure enhances relationships involved assessments of self-disclosure that were based on across-situation generalizations (i.e., the degree to which one generally discloses to a particular partner). We would agree that, when measured in this way, high self-disclosure should be associated with positive relationship functioning, as it would suggest the building of intimacy and general trust in the partner’s responsiveness to self-disclosure (
        Reis &amp; Shaver, 1988). These global measures, however, may mask important contextual effects. In specific situations, self-disclosure of needs and desires should increase the likelihood that perceivers define the situation as diagnostic of partners’ sentiments. Therefore, following perceived self-disclosure, perceivers should feel trust when partners behave in a responsive manner, but lack of trust when they behave in an unresponsive manner.
      </p><a id="psp-106-1-37-EHDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_25" title="Overview">Overview</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The conceptual model guiding the present research appears in 
        Figure 1. According to this model, perceivers judge their own self-disclosure of needs and desires in accordance with their partner’s responsive behavior, which includes underestimating disclosure when the partner is unresponsive. This process should be stronger when perceivers highly value their relationship with the partner. In turn, given that perceived self-disclosure of needs and desires is thought to serve as a diagnosticity cue, underestimating disclosure should be directly related to perceiving the partner’s behavior as less diagnostic of the partner’s sentiments. We test these views in six studies. In Studies 1 and 2, using two different methodologies, we contrasted global perceptions of self-disclosure with perceptions of self-disclosure in specific situations characterized by target partners’ lack of responsiveness. Consistent with the large body of research suggesting that global self-disclosure has positive relationship consequences, we expected that motivated perceivers (i.e., perceivers who strongly value a relationship with targets) would claim high global self-disclosure. However, consistent with our analysis of disclosure as diagnosticity, we expected that these perceivers would see lack of disclosure in situations characterized by targets’ lack of responsiveness. Furthermore, we expected that this pattern of high global self-disclosure and low self-disclosure in situations characterized by partners’ unresponsive behavior would be associated with the most positive relationship perceptions (i.e., reduced perceptions of diagnosticity of partners’ unresponsive behavior and increased trust). In Study 3, we used a daily report study to test this model with regard to daily interactions between romantic partners. In Study 4, we tested the model using a behavioral observation study. In Studies 5 and 6, we experimentally manipulated desire to bond and reduction of threat, respectively, to test predictions regarding the motivational nature of this bias.

This comparison is central to the distinction between prior research and theory on self-disclosure and the current model. As we described earlier, prior research reveals positive associations of relationship sentiments with global self-disclosure, suggesting that the existence or perception of global disclosure can maintain and enhance relationships. However, perceiving insufficient self-disclosure in unresponsive situations may undermine the diagnosticity of partners’ unresponsive behavior and therefore maintain trust in partners’ care and commitment, a desirable outcome for perceivers who strongly value maintaining relationships with partners. Hence, perceivers who strongly value their partners should be much more likely to report more global self-disclosure (i.e., that they disclose generally) relative to self-disclosure in specific situations characterized by the partner’s unresponsive behavior. In addition, perceivers who strongly value their partners should report more global self-disclosure in their relationships relative to perceivers who do not strongly value their partners. However, when with regard to unresponsive situations, perceivers who value partners should perceive low disclosure, perhaps just as low as the disclosure perceived by those who do not value partners. This tendency to see low self-disclosure in unresponsive situations should be associated with reduced perceptions of diagnosticity in these situations and more trust in partners’ care and commitment. In contrast, and consistent with prior research on the relational benefits of global self-disclosure in most other contexts, global perceptions of self-disclosure should be associated with positive relationship perceptions (i.e., perceiving unresponsive behaviors as nondiagnostic and trusting partners’ care and commitment). We tested these predictions using hypothetical vignettes, which allowed us to capture general explanatory styles while holding constant the specific features of interactions. Prior research on attributions in relationships suggests that studies using this methodology produce results that are parallel to studies examining attributions of actual events (
        Bradbury &amp; Fincham, 1990). We directly address this issue by examining actual events in Study 2.

Global self-disclosure, however, should reflect well-functioning relationships and positive relationship perceptions, and therefore should be associated with perceiving unresponsive behaviors as less diagnostic. To test these predictions, we regressed situation-specific diagnosticity perceptions on both situation-specific and global perceptions of self-disclosure. Situation-specific self-disclosure (in unresponsive situations) positively predicted diagnosticity perceptions, β = .29,

          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We tested a similar model of global trust in targets’ care and commitment, which produced similar results.

These results provide strong evidence that global and specific perceptions of self-disclosure can have opposite implications for trust.

Participants who strongly valued a relationship with a target person perceived high levels of self-disclosure in a global sense, but they also perceived low levels of self-disclosure in unresponsive situations. This pattern of high global self-disclosure and low self-disclosure in unresponsive situations was associated with reduced perceptions of diagnosticity of unresponsive behavior and increased trust in partners’ care and commitment, which is consistent with both prior research suggesting benefits of self-disclosure generally, and the current prediction proposing benefits of perceived lack of disclosure in unresponsive situations.
            <a id="b-fn3"> </a><sup /> In contrast, participants who did not value a relationship with the target person exhibited a trust-diminishing tendency to see more disclosure in unresponsive situations than globally. Both patterns are consistent with the view that levels of relationship desire determine whether people hold trust-enhancing or trust-diminishing perceptions.

        Kenny &amp; Acitelli, 2001; 
        Lemay et al., 2007; 
        Murray et al., 1996a), this procedure allows us to statistically remove the influence of targets’ perceptions from analyses of perceivers’ perceptions. To the extent that convergence across perceivers and targets reflects perceivers’ accuracy, this procedure statistically removes the portion of perceivers’ perceptions explained by accuracy.

Study 1 examined attributions of hypothetical events, which may not reflect attributions of actual events. Study 2 examined attributions of actual events, but these events occurred in the distant past and so memory biases could have altered the results. The daily report method used in Study 3 addresses these issues by examining perceptions of everyday relationship events. Moreover, Studies 1 and 2 compared perceptions of disclosure in specific unresponsive situations to perceptions of global disclosure. Although this comparison is theoretically relevant in light of the current model and the bulk of prior research on global perceptions of disclosure, it did not address disclosure perceptions in specific situations characterized by the partner’s responsive behavior, leaving open the possibility that perceived disclosure is threatening to trust in all specific situations (rather than just unresponsive situations). The current study corrects this issue by examining specific relationship events (i.e., daily interaction) that vary in terms of valence of partner behavior.</p><a id="psp-106-1-37-EBEDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Study 3 included a sample of 98 heterosexual romantically involved dyads.

To test this prediction, we regressed perceivers’ daily perceptions of self-disclosure on their daily perceptions of targets’ responsive behavior, perceivers’ chronic valuing of targets, and a product term representing their interaction.

Daily perceptions of self-disclosure as a function of daily perceptions of partner’s responsive behavior and chronic valuing of the partner (Study 3).</em></span></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Next, we examined the effects of perceivers’ chronic valuing at low and high levels of daily perceived partner responsiveness. In other words, do perceivers who value targets always see more self-disclosure relative to perceivers who do not value targets, or does this depend on whether partners behaved in a responsive or unresponsive manner that day? Perceivers’ who chronically valued targets perceived more self-disclosure than low-valuing perceivers on days when they perceived that targets were relatively responsive (1 
            <em>SD</em> above the mean, 
            <em>b</em> = .38, 
            <em>t</em>(409.83) = 3.88, 
            <em>p</em> &lt; .001, but not on days when they thought targets were unresponsive (1 
            <em>SD</em> below the mean; 
            <em>p</em> &gt; .55). These results suggest that the above effect in which partner valuing was associated with more self-disclosure only pertained to situations in which the partner behaved in a responsive manner. When partners were unresponsive, perceivers who valued partners saw just as little self-disclosure as perceivers who did not chronically value partners.
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">This interaction pattern was found while controlling for target partners’ judgments of perceivers’ self-disclosure, which also predicted perceivers’ judgments of their self-disclosure (
            <em>b</em> = .07), 
            <em>t</em>(1078.61) = 2.55, 
            <em>p</em> &lt; .05. This unsurprising effect indicates that, in addition to the bias demonstrated above, there was a small degree of agreement between perceivers and targets regarding perceivers’ self-disclosure. Such agreement is an indicator of accuracy. Most important for the present research, we found evidence for the predicted bias while controlling for this agreement between perceivers and targets, suggesting that accuracy cannot explain these results. In addition, we tested another model using partners’ perceptions of perceivers’ self-disclosure as the outcome variable in place of perceivers’ self-perceived disclosure. The interaction reported above was not significant in this model (
            <em>p</em> &gt; .20). Hence, the tendency for highly valuing perceivers to deny self-disclosure on days when partners were unresponsive was not corroborated by their partner’s perceptions of perceivers’ self-disclosure, which also suggests that motivated perceivers’ denial of self-disclosure was, at least in part, a perceptual bias.
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Predicting perceived diagnosticity</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We expect that motivated perceivers deviate from their typical perceptions of high self-disclosure when partners are unresponsive because the perception of low self-disclosure helps perceivers make the claim that the partner’s unresponsive behavior is not diagnostic of the partner’s feelings or motivations. To test whether low self-disclosure is indeed associated with low perceived diagnosticity, we regressed perceivers’ daily perceptions of diagnosticity on their daily perceptions of self-disclosure. We controlled for target partners’ daily perceptions of perceivers’ self-disclosure and target partners’ daily perceptions of the diagnosticity of their own behavior to be sure that results could not be explained by perceptions of disclosure or diagnosticity that were shared by both perceivers and targets (i.e., accurate perceptions). Perceivers’ daily perceptions of self-disclosure strongly predicted their diagnosticity perceptions (
            <em>b</em> = .45), 
            <em>t</em>(1102.65) = 16.93, 
            <em>p</em> &lt; .001. Perceivers who saw themselves as low in self-disclosure on a particular day perceived partners’ behavior as less diagnostic of partners’ underlying sentiments on that day, and this effect was independent of partners’ perceptions of perceivers’ disclosure and partners’ self-perceptions of diagnosticity.

However, these perceivers had perceptions of disclosure that were contingent on partners’ daily responsive behavior. They saw high self-disclosure on days when partners behaved in a responsive manner, but they saw low disclosure on days when partners were unresponsive, just as low as perceivers who did not value relationships with partners. This pattern was not corroborated by partners’ reports of perceivers’ self-disclosure, consistent with the hypothesis that perceivers’ perceptions of low self-disclosure are, in part, illusory. Seeing lack of disclosure when partners were unresponsive was related to viewing the unresponsive behavior as less diagnostic of partners’ sentiments, suggesting that these perceptions of low self-disclosure had a benefit. This effect also was independent of partners’ reports of self-disclosure and diagnosticity, which again suggests they were partially the result of perceivers’ biased perceptions.

To provide a stronger test of our prediction that perceivers have illusory perceptions of their self-disclosure, we compared their perceptions of self-disclosure to two external indexes of their self-disclosure, including target partners’ and objective observers’ judgments. In addition, we improved upon the measurement of targets’ responsiveness by incorporating judgments from three sources, including judgments made by perceivers, by targets themselves, and by objective observers. Analogous to the findings reported in our prior studies, we predicted that perceivers who strongly value a relationship with the target partner would judge their own self-disclosure in accordance with the target’s responsive behavior even while controlling for perceivers’ self-disclosure as indexed by targets and objective observers.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We theorize that underestimating self-disclosure can reduce diagnosticity of the partner’s unresponsive behavior and therefore maintain trust. Rather than directly examining diagnosticity perceptions, as we did in our prior studies, we examined whether underestimating self-disclosure would buffer perceivers’ responses to partners’ unresponsive behavior, including negative affect and relationship evaluations. Partners’ unresponsive behavior should be less likely to elicit perceivers’ negative affect or reductions in commitment and satisfaction, which are common responses to threatened trust (
        Murray et al., 2006) and suggest that perceivers believed the unresponsive behavior was diagnostic, if perceivers underestimate their self-disclosure.

First, we created an index of disclosure illusions using a regression residual approach. We regressed perceivers’ perceptions of their own self-disclosure on objective judges’ views and targets’ views of perceivers’ self-disclosure. Perceivers’ perceptions of their own self-disclosure were significantly predicted by both objective judges’ views, β = .30, 
            <em>t</em>(238) = 4.56, 
            <em>sr</em><sup>2</sup> = .072,

            <em>p</em> &lt; .01. Together, these predictors explained 17% of the variance in perceivers’ judgments of their own disclosure. We used the raw residuals from this analysis as an index of disclosure illusions. Perceivers with positive residuals perceived their own self-disclosure to be greater than what could be predicted on the basis of targets’ and objective observers’ perceptions of perceivers’ disclosure, an apparent overestimation of disclosure, whereas perceivers with negative residuals perceived their own disclosure to be less than what could be predicted on the basis of targets’ and objective observers’ perceptions of perceivers’ disclosure, an apparent underestimation of disclosure.
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We then tested the model described previously after replacing the criterion variable with this index of disclosure illusions. The intercept in this model reflects the average disclosure illusion (i.e., difference between perceivers’ perceptions of self-disclosure and the value predicted on the basis of targets’ and observers’ perceptions) when all predictors have a score of 0. The significance test associated with this intercept indicates whether this average illusion is significantly different from 0. We re-centered perceivers’ valuing of targets and targets’ responsiveness on low (1 
            <em>SD</em> below the mean) and high (1 
            <em>SD</em> above the mean) values to examine average illusions as a function of these predictors. When perceivers strongly valued targets (1 
            <em>SD</em> above the mean) and targets were unresponsive (1 
            <em>SD</em> below the mean), perceivers exhibited significantly negative disclosure illusions,

            <em>t</em>(232) = −2.37,

Perceivers who valued relationships with targets appeared to judge their own self-disclosure in accordance with targets’ responsive behavior, underestimating their disclosure when targets were unresponsive and overestimating their disclosure when targets were responsive. We found this pattern while controlling for targets’ and objective observers’ perceptions of perceivers’ disclosure, suggesting that perceivers had biased perceptions. Perceivers’ underestimation of self-disclosure appeared to serve a purpose; perceivers who underestimated their own disclosure had affective reactions and relationship evaluations that were less strongly dependent on targets’ responsive behavior. They felt less upset and were less likely to devalue their relationships when they responded to their partner’s unresponsive behavior by underestimating their own self-disclosure.

After identifying an event in which valued or devalued targets were not responsive (which should elicit perceivers’ motivation to undermine diagnosticity when targets are valued but not when they are devalued), some perceivers received an opportunity to satisfy the motivation to undermine the diagnosticity of the partner’s unresponsive behavior by endorsing a variety of explanations of the unresponsive behavior, all of which preserved the sense that targets still cared for perceivers. Hence, these explanations suggested that the unresponsive behavior lacked diagnosticity. Perceivers then completed measures assessing perceptions of self-disclosure during the event. We expected that perceivers who were offered other opportunities to reduce diagnosticity would see more self-disclosure during the unresponsive event relative to perceivers in the control condition, who were not offered these opportunities. Moreover, we expected that this pattern would pertain only to perceivers who highly valued relationships with targets. This pattern would be consistent with our view that underestimating self-disclosure is motivated by desire to reduce diagnosticity of a valued partner’s unresponsive behavior, as a hallmark of motivated processes is that they decrease in strength once the motivation has been satisfied through some other means (e.g.,

First, they completed a biased checklist. Each item on the checklist provided participants with a way to reduce perceived diagnosticity of the unresponsive behavior (besides underestimating self-disclosure), including temporal distancing (i.e., “The event in which [partner name] did not help me happened a long time ago. Our relationship is stronger now.”), downplaying partner ability (i.e., “[Partner name] would have helped me during this event, but he/she was not really able to help.”), direct denial of diagnosticity (i.e., “Even though [partner name] did not help me during this one event, he/she still cares for me.”), diminishing importance of the event (i.e., “This event was not very important in the grand scheme of my relationship with [partner name].”), encapsulating the event (i.e., “Even though [partner name] did not help me in this one instance, he/she helps me with almost everything.”), and denial of need (i.e., “The reason why [partner name] did not help me during this event was that I was not truly in need of help from him/her.”). Presentation of this checklist was intended to provide participants with several ways to undermine diagnosticity of the partner’s unresponsive behavior. Indeed, on average participants in this condition endorsed 2.04 statements. Hence, participants in this condition generally took the opportunity to reduce diagnosticity.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Next, participants in the motivation satisfaction condition completed this open-ended question: “Above you mentioned an event in which [partner name] did not help you. How do you explain [partner name’s] failure to help, and how does it affect your relationship? For example, you might know that [partner name] still cares for you, your relationship may have grown since this event, or you may not have needed [partner name’s] help during this event.” We asked this question to provide participants with an opportunity to reduce diagnosticity of the unresponsive behavior in their own words, and the examples we provided were intended to lead participants to reduce diagnosticity. Most participants did reduce diagnosticity, indicating that partners were unable to help, that they did not need partners’ help, that partners still cared for them, or that the partner’s failure to help was unimportant and had little effect on the relationship. Participants in the control condition did not complete either of these tasks.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">All participants then completed the four-item situation-specific measures of self-disclosure described in Studies 2 and 5 using 7-point response scales (1 = 
            <em>strongly disagree</em>; 7 = 
            <em>strongly agree</em>; Cronbach’s α = .89). Items were completed with regard to the event in which the partner did not provide support, and they were scored such that higher scores represented more disclosure. Participants also completed a six-item measure of relationship commitment (Cronbach’s α = .94) and a four-item measure of care for the partner (Cronbach’s α = .93). Responses to these two scales were highly correlated (Cronbach’s α = .94) and were averaged to create an index of partner valuing for use in some analyses.

Preliminary analyses revealed a main effect of gender. To reduce error variance and improve our ability to detect an effect, we also controlled for gender in our analysis (–.5 = women; .5 = men).

          Figure 8. We examined the conditional effects of the motivation satisfaction manipulation, which address whether, relative to the control condition, satisfying the motivation to undermine diagnosticity increases perceptions of self-disclosure (because it reduces the need to deny self-disclosure). Consistent with predictions, this manipulation did not affect self-disclosure perceptions for participants in the devalued partner condition, who lacked motivation to undermine diagnosticity in the first place (
          <em>p</em> &gt; .74). However, this manipulation did increase self-disclosure perceptions for participants in the valued partner condition, β = .19,

          <em>M</em> = 3.03). This pattern is consistent with predictions and suggests that a motivated process reduces perceptions of disclosure—participants who highly valued partners perceived more self-disclosure of their needs and desires in a situation characterized by the partner’s lack of responsiveness when the motivation to reduce diagnosticity of this unresponsive behavior was satisfied in some other manner. Given that participants reporting on a devalued partner lacked a strong motivation to undermine diagnosticity of the partner’s unresponsive behavior, the manipulation to satisfy this motivation did not have an effect on them. We also examined the conditional effects of the partner valuing condition, but these effects were not significant (

          <em>t</em>(226) = 2.24, 
          <em>sr</em><sup>2</sup> = .021, 
          <em>p</em> &lt; .05, consistent with predictions and the results reported above. We also examined conditional effects of partner valuing, which examine whether perceivers who value partners are more likely to deny disclosure relative to participants who do not value partners. Partner valuing was inversely associated with self-disclosure perceptions in the control condition, β = –.26, 
          <em>t</em>(226) = −2.45, 
          <em>sr</em><sup>2</sup> = .025, 
          <em>p</em> &lt; .05. Partner valuing did not predict self-disclosure perceptions in the motivation satisfaction condition (
          <em>p</em> &gt; .56). The more participants valued the partner, the more likely they were to deny self-disclosure, but this was only the case in the control condition. The motivation satisfaction manipulation—providing participants with other methods for undermining diagnosticity of the partner’s unresponsive behavior—eliminated the tendency for highly motivated perceivers to deny self-disclosure.

In the control condition, partner valuing was inversely associated with self-disclosure perceptions, suggesting that motivated perceivers denied self-disclosure. However, this effect was eliminated and motivated perceivers admitted high self-disclosure if we provided them with other opportunities to satisfy the motivation to construe the unresponsive behavior as nondiagnostic of the partner’s sentiments. In other words, motivated perceivers seemed to substitute one method of reducing diagnosticity (i.e., denying self-disclosure) with other methods that we suggested. This evidence of substitution—of reduced use of a particular strategy after using other strategies that serve the same goal—is a hallmark of a motivated process.</p><a id="psp-106-1-37-EADA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_181" title="General Discussion">General Discussion</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In the current research, we tested the prediction that, when confronted with a relationship partner’s unresponsive behavior, perceivers who strongly value a close relationship with the partner tend to reconstrue the situation as nondiagnostic by diminishing the extent to which they disclosed needs and desires. In turn, this process should protect feelings of trust. The overarching goal of the current research was to demonstrate the existence of this process.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Studies 1 and 2 were designed to contrast perceptions of self-disclosure in unresponsive situations (i.e., situations in which the partner behaved in a cold, selfish, or neglectful manner) with global perceptions of disclosure, the latter of which is emphasized in most research on the link between self-disclosure and relationship quality. Those who highly valued a relationship with the target partner tended to report high levels of global self-disclosure in their relationship, consistent with prior findings suggesting that positive relationship sentiments are associated with high levels of self-disclosure. However, in both hypothetical (Study 1) and actual (Study 2) unresponsive situations, these same perceivers reported low levels of self-disclosure, just as low as the self-disclosure reported by those who did not value relationships with the target partner. In turn, these two types of disclosure perceptions had opposite implications for trust and diagnosticity perceptions. Perceivers who perceived high global self-disclosure reported high levels of trust and saw partners’ unresponsive behavior as less diagnostic of the partner’s lack of care. Yet the pattern was reversed for perceptions of disclosure in unresponsive situations. In such situations, perceived self-disclosure was negatively related to trust and positively related to perceiving partners’ unresponsive behaviors as diagnostic. These results are consistent with our view that self-disclosure of needs and desires can undermine trust if the disclosure is perceived in situations characterized by the partner’s lack of responsiveness, even while perceptions of global self-disclosure have relationship-enhancing effects.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Why the drop in perceptions of self-disclosure in these unresponsive situations? In part, this effect may reflect the fact that perceivers actually disclose less in these situations. We also believe that individuals who highly value their relationships are motivated to construct illusory perceptions of self-disclosure in ways that render unresponsive behaviors nondiagnostic. This issue of bias was addressed in the remaining studies.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Study 3 replicated results from the first two studies using a dyadic daily report methodology and while statistically controlling for partners’ perceptions of self-disclosure and diagnosticity, which provides stronger evidence for perceivers’ perceptual bias. Independently of partners’ perceptions of perceivers’ self-disclosure, perceivers reported high self-disclosure on days when partners behaved in a responsive manner, and they reported low self-disclosure on days when partners behaved in an unresponsive manner. This pattern was especially strong when perceivers highly valued a relationship with partners. In addition, perceivers’ valuing of partners was associated with perceptions of self-disclosure only on days when partners behaved in a responsive manner. Perceivers’ valuing of partners did not predict self-disclosure on days when partners were low in responsive behavior. On these days, highly valuing perceivers saw just as little self-disclosure as low-valuing perceivers. Hence, once again, the pattern of self-disclosure associated with positive relationship sentiments, which is reported in most studies of self-disclosure and relationship evaluations, was not observed in unresponsive situations. Moreover, perceivers dismissed partners’ behavior as not diagnostic of their sentiments on days when perceivers reported low self-disclosure, replicating the link between situation-specific self-disclosure and diagnosticity perceptions reported in Studies 1 and 2. This effect also was independent of partners’ perceptions of disclosure and diagnosticity. This pattern suggests that motivated perceivers protected against targets’ unresponsive behavior by downplaying self-disclosure, substantiating the conclusion that partners’ unresponsive behaviors do not convey lack of care.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In Study 4, we conducted stronger tests of our model by incorporating objective observers’ judgments of the behaviors enacted during a social support interaction. Relative to perceivers’ self-disclosure as perceived by 11 objective observers and by target partners, perceivers who strongly valued a relationship with targets appeared to exaggerate their own self-disclosure when target partners behaved in a supportive manner and downplay their self-disclosure when targets were unresponsive. In addition, this study provided evidence for buffering effects of underestimating self-disclosure. Underestimating their own self-disclosure appeared to reduce perceivers’ negative affective reactions and negative relationship evaluations following targets’ unresponsive behavior, suggesting that this underestimation stripped the potency from the unresponsive behavior.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Studies 5 and 6 provided stronger evidence for the role of motivation. In Study 5, some perceivers had an opportunity to reaffirm their valuing of target partners before completing the measures of self-disclosure with regard to an unresponsive situation. This affirmation of valuing resulted in perceiving less self-disclosure in the unresponsive situation, suggesting that desire to bond is a driving force in denying self-disclosure in these situations. In Study 6, some perceivers had an opportunity to satisfy the motivation to undermine diagnosticity of a partner’s unresponsive behavior in other ways before completing the measures of self-disclosure in the unresponsive situation. Relative to a control condition, presentation of this opportunity increased perceptions of self-disclosure, but only if participants strongly valued relationships with partners. Hence, for people who valued partners, perceptions of self-disclosure appeared to be suppressed in the control condition to satisfy the goal to reduce diagnosticity of the valued partner’s unresponsive behavior. Apparently, self-disclosure no longer needed to be denied when this goal to undermine diagnosticity was satisfied in some other way. These results suggest that the motivation to maintain trust by undermining the diagnosticity of valued partners’ unresponsive behavior, when not satisfied through other mechanisms, prompts people to underestimate self-disclosure.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">These findings have important implications for the psychological determinants of trust, as well as the existing literature on self-disclosure and motivated cognition in relationships. Theorizing on trust proposes that trust is formed over time from repeated observations of a target partner’s behavior in diagnostic situations (
        Holmes &amp; Rempel, 1989; 
        Kelley et al., 2003; 
        Shallcross &amp; Simpson, 2012; 
        Simpson, 2007a, 
        2007b), which are situations in which the partner’s behavior is thought to be indicative of the partner’s sentiments toward the self and relationships. Self-disclosure of needs and desires appears to be a central characteristic of these situations. That is, it is primarily when people have expressed a need or wish to their partner that people can determine whether the partner is motivated to fulfill needs and wishes, a central component of trust. Theorizing on these diagnostic situations suggests that they are risky—that sometimes these self-disclosures elicit responses from partners that damage trust and communicate partners’ selfishness. Indeed, rejection risk is a primary reason for avoiding self-disclosure (
        Omarzu, 2000). This view on trust is rather “bottom-up” or “data driven” in that it suggests that trust is the result of accumulated observations of partners in “test” situations. However, the current findings suggest the origins of trust are more complex. In addition to experience-driven processes involving the observation of partners’ behaviors in diagnostic situations, trust appears to be the result of “top down” processes that stem from perceivers’ motivation to bond with targets.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The current model and findings are somewhat counterintuitive. Most theoretical perspectives on self-disclosure suggest that disclosure is associated with positive relationship functioning (e.g., 
        Altman &amp; Taylor, 1973; 
        Finkenauer &amp; Righetti, 2011; 
        Reis &amp; Shaver, 1988). However, the current model suggests something different. Because self-perceived disclosure of needs and desires heightens perceptions of situational diagnosticity, disclosure is not inherently positive or negative, and does not inherently facilitate closeness. To understand the interpersonal consequences of self-disclosure and whether self-disclosure is a pleasant interpersonal perception, we would argue that partners’ responses to the self-disclosure must be considered (see also 
        Reis &amp; Shaver, 1988). Studies that examine only global perceptions of self-disclosure, and those that examine self-disclosure in specific situations but ignore how effects are moderated by partners’ responses, may mask important negative components of specific disclosure episodes, such as the painful and trust-undermining experience of disclosing needs and desires and receiving an unsupportive response. Theorizing and empirical studies on self-disclosure should consider contextual factors that alter (i.e., moderate) its meaning and consequences, especially how partners respond to disclosure.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The bias we studied most likely has boundary conditions. The nature of motivated cognition is such that perceivers’ ability to arrive at desired conclusions is constrained by their ability to rationally justify those conclusions (
        Kunda, 1990). We expect that features of individuals, situations, and relationships may constrain perceivers’ abilities to underestimate self-disclosure. For example, sometimes perceivers’ disclosures may be so clear that it is virtually impossible to deny them. Under these conditions, most perceivers may abandon the strategy of diminishing self-disclosure and either perceive partners’ behaviors as diagnostic or adopt other strategies to undermine diagnosticity. The substitutability of strategies to undermine diagnosticity of negative behaviors demonstrated in Study 6 likely works in the reversed direction as well, such that perceivers more heavily rely on other strategies to undermine diagnosticity when diminishing disclosure is not feasible. Motivated perceivers may instead cling to beliefs that partners were unable to enact responsive behaviors, that they did not need partners to enact responsive behaviors, or that situational factors accounted for unresponsive behaviors. Identifying the factors of situations, perceivers, and relationships that guide the selection of these trust-regulation strategies is an important task for future research.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We expect that the reason why self-disclosure heightens perceptions of diagnosticity is because this disclosure leads perceivers to believe that partners were aware of their needs and desires. However, this perception of partners’ awareness could arise from processes other than self-disclosure. For example, in some instances, perceivers may believe that partners know their needs and desires as a result of a transparency illusion—the tendency for people to believe that internal states are more observable to others than they really are (
        Gilovich, Savitsky, &amp; Medvec, 1998). This illusion of transparency may create the false sense that needs and desires have been communicated to others even when no disclosure has occurred, resulting in the perception that situations are more diagnostic than they are (
        Vorauer, Cameron, Holmes, &amp; Pearce, 2003). When people believe their needs and desires are understood through such a process, diminishing perceptions of self-disclosure may do little to reduce perceptions of diagnosticity. More generally, denying self-disclosure may not be an effective means of supporting the belief that partners’ behavior is irrelevant to partners’ relationship motives if, for reasons other than self-disclosure, perceivers believe that partners know their needs and desires. By the same logic, perceivers who acknowledge that they have engaged in self-disclosure may still believe that a situation is irrelevant to a partner’s motives if they have reason to believe that the partner did not understand their needs and desires.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">However, we do not propose that perceivers usually protect trust by directly denying unresponsive partners’ awareness. Claiming that partners did not know needs and desires, even when one engaged in clear self-disclosure, would likely involve attributing undesirable qualities to partners involving their lack of ability or motivation to attend to and interpret self-disclosures (e.g., the partner is not very astute or caring). Moreover, unlike denying self-disclosure, downplaying partners’ understanding may jeopardize perceivers’ sense of optimism and control regarding future support interactions. That is, if they adequately self-disclosed but partners did not understand, what could they possibly do next time to ensure they receive responsive support? Diminishing understanding would likely need to be done in a manner that instead preserves trust that future expressions of need will be met with responsiveness. For instance, perceivers could make situational attributions for partners’ lack of understanding (e.g., the partner did not understand this time because he/she was preoccupied with his/her own stressors but will be understanding and responsive next time; see 
        Bradbury &amp; Fincham, 1990).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Trust, in addition to desire, likely determines whether people downplay disclosure and diagnosticity in unresponsive situations. According to the risk-regulation model (
        Murray et al., 2006), people who are chronically confident in their partner’s regard are comfortable with choosing strategies that minimize feelings of vulnerability by increasing connection with and dependence on the partner. Those who doubt their partner’s regard find these strategies to be overly risky and unjustifiable. We have instead emphasized the role of chronic relationship desire, predicting that perceivers who strongly want to maintain communal relationships with partners choose strategies that are consistent with this goal, including making positive appraisals of the partner’s behavior, and we have viewed trust as the consequence of adopting these strategies. We expect that a more complete understanding of the bias we have examined (and interpersonal cognition more generally) would require the consideration of trust and desire as independent predictors of interpersonal perception. Congruence with broader desires to maintain connection and perceived riskiness of maintaining connection may jointly determine the adoption of trust-enhancing cognitive biases. Moreover, these biases may contribute to future desire and trust, suggesting feedback loops.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Such a possibility suggests that the bias we identified is useful for perceivers and enhances their well-being, but this may depend on a number of other factors. Perceivers who downplay their own self-disclosure in unresponsive situations may perceive their partners to be caring, and this perception of care may contribute to subsequent prorelationship behaviors (
        Lemay &amp; Clark, 2008; 
        Murray et al., 2000; 
        Wieselquist et al., 1999). From this vantage point, diminishing disclosure would seem to have positive consequences for perceivers. However, this bias, like other biases, could mask important relationship problems, which could interfere with resolution of those problems (
        McNulty, O’Mara, &amp; Karney, 2008) or prevent perceivers from abandoning a harmful relationship. From this view, the bias we identified could seem to be harmful for the well-being of relationships or perceivers. A complete understanding of the consequences of this bias may require understanding of relationship context. Are there significant problems in the relationship that require explicit acknowledgment and resolution, which are impeded by the bias? Alternatively, does the bias motivate behaviors that can improve the relationship, even if problems are glossed over? One possibility is that the extent of bias is proportional to the severity of relationship problems. Severe or harmful relationship problems may extinguish positive biases for most perceivers. As we stated earlier, perceivers must be able to rationally justify the conclusions they make, which may be difficult when relationships are extremely problematic, and this may often provide a safeguard against entertaining biases in the face of realities that render them harmful.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Our research provided evidence for a second bias: perceivers who highly valued relationships with targets appeared to overestimate their disclosure when targets behaved in a prorelationship manner. This is the converse of the underestimation of disclosure bias we emphasized. Perhaps motivated perceivers capitalized on targets’ responsive behavior by exaggerating self-disclosure and, in turn, diagnosticity, essentially inflating the intentional supportiveness behind their partners’ positive acts (e.g., my partner’s helpfulness was not just because of a good mood or general helpful character but was instead the result of a strong motivation to respond to the needs I communicated). This bias may enhance perceptions of partners’ care and commitment. Future research should consider the motives and benefits of this apparent exaggeration of self-disclosure.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Our findings have implications for the relative importance of perceived self-disclosure and trust in partner’s care. As we have already mentioned, plenty of evidence suggests that optimal relationship functioning is characterized by the presence of each of these components. However, as we have demonstrated, perceived self-disclosure increases the perceived diagnosticity of situations and therefore introduces a tradeoff with perceived partner care when partners have behaved in an unresponsive manner. In these situations, what is the more desirable trade? Our findings consistently suggest that when it comes to perceiving inadequate disclosure versus perceiving inadequate partner care, inadequate disclosure is viewed as the lesser of two evils. That is, people may be willing to forgo the conclusion that needs and desires have been effectively disclosed if this maintains the perception that valued partners care for those needs and desires. Perhaps this is a sensible trade. After all, many of the benefits of self-disclosure, and of relationships more generally, depend on having a caring partner. Hence, in certain situations, people may have good reason to embrace the perception that their relationships are riddled with communication difficulties and misunderstandings; sometimes it is better to concede a small loss en route to a larger victory.</p><a id="psp-106-1-37-R" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_198" title="Footnotes">Footnotes</a></span><a id="fn1" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><sup>1</sup> The challenges of conducting research over the Internet are well documented (

These challenges include multiple submissions by the same individual, inability to control the testing environment, which introduces noise, high dropout rates, and reductions of participants’ investment of time and energy into the research tasks. We took a number of steps to address these issues. First, we tracked Internet protocol (IP) addresses and eliminated submissions that were identical to a prior submission with regard to both the IP address and the participant’s age, which should address the problem of repeat responders. Second, to address issues of reduced investment of time and energy, we tracked questionnaire completion times and eliminated all responses provided by participants who did not spend more than 5 min on the questionnaire.

        Our conceptual model indicates that perceivers’ valuing of partners moderates effects of daily perceptions of partners’ responsiveness on their perceptions of self-disclosure. In turn, perceptions of disclosure are closely tied to perceiving partner behaviors as diagnostic, and this link is not moderated. This is why we included different predictors in models of perceived disclosure and perceived diagnosticity. Indeed, in subsequent analyses we found that the link between daily perceived disclosure and daily perceived diagnosticity was not moderated by perceivers’ chronic valuing of targets (
