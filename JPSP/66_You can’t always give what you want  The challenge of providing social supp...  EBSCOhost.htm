In the current article, we examine some reasons for this difficulty, with a focus on support recipients’ self-esteem as a crucial variable. We predicted that recipients’ receptiveness to support would be influenced by both support strategy and recipient self-esteem and that receptiveness in turn would impact providers’ perceived caregiving efficacy and relationship quality. Study 1 (hypothetical scenarios), Study 2 (confederate interaction), and Study 3 (reports of recently received support) showed that individuals with low self-esteem (LSEs) are less receptive than are individuals with high self-esteem (HSEs) to support that positively reframes their experience but are equally receptive to support that validates their negative feelings. In Study 4, providers demonstrated some knowledge that positive reframing would be less helpful to LSEs than to HSEs but indicated equal intention to give such support. Study 5 showed that, in a real interaction, friends were indeed equally likely to offer positive reframing to both LSEs and HSEs but were less likely to offer validation to LSEs. LSEs were less accepting of such support, and in turn providers felt worse about the interaction, about themselves, and about their friendship more broadly. Study 6 confirmed that recipients’ receptivity to support directly influenced providers’ experience of a support interaction as well as their self- and relationship evaluations. The findings illustrate how well-meaning support attempts that do not match recipients’ particular preferences may be detrimental to both members of the dyad.

No matter their desirable qualities—intelligence, physical attractiveness, talent—these friends often interpret critical feedback, romantic rebuffs, or rejected job applications as further evidence of their general unworthiness. As such, they seem resistant to your reminders of how positively you see them, to your reframing of their problem as an opportunity for growth, and to your expressions of optimism and encouragement for bettering their situation. Supporting these friends may seem frustrating and tiring, so much so that you come to dread and even avoid social contact when you know they are struggling with a personal problem. Who are these individuals, and why are they so resistant to what you believe is caring and thoughtful support? Could there be a more effective way to support them, which leaves you feeling both fulfilled and satisfied with the interaction?</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In this paper, we show that individuals with low self-esteem (LSEs) are often resistant to being cheered up by their well-meaning friends after experiencing failure or rejection, and we draw on theories of self-verification and mood regulation to understand LSEs’ resistance. We further explore the extent of providers’ knowledge of self-esteem differences in support preferences and the consequences of providing support that does not match these preferences for both recipients’ and providers’ experience of the interaction and of their friendships more broadly. The providers’ perspective on unsuccessful support interactions has received little attention in the social support literature. We seek to redress that imbalance in this paper.</p><a id="psp-107-1-56-ELDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_7" title="Social Support Strategies">Social Support Strategies</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The belief that family, friends, and romantic partners are willing and able to provide effective support during times of stress has been consistently linked to good mental and physical health (for reviews, see 
        Lakey &amp; Orehek, 2011; 
        Uchino, Cacioppo, &amp; Kiecolt-Glaser, 1996). However, enacted social support does not always have beneficial effects; in fact, it may yield negative effects on recipients in terms of mood, optimism, self-esteem, and coping (e.g., 
        Bolger &amp; Amarel, 2007; 
        Bolger, Zuckerman, &amp; Kessler, 2000; 
        Dunkel-Schetter, Blasband, Feinstein, &amp; Herbert, 1992; 
        Kaul &amp; Lakey, 2003). Unfortunately, the provider’s good intentions are not sufficient to ensure sensitive and effective support (
        Burleson, 2003a). For support to be effective it seems to matter more that support fits well with what recipients perceive as their needs, rather than some objective assessment of need arising from the situation (
        Burleson, 2009; 
        Dunkel-Schetter et al., 1992; 
        Rafaeli &amp; Gleason, 2009).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">There are certain kinds of support that are almost always helpful (e.g., expressing care, concern, interest, and affection) and some that are almost always unhelpful (e.g., criticizing and blaming the recipient; 
        Burleson, 2003a; 
        Rafaeli &amp; Gleason, 2009). Much gray area remains between these two classes of behavior in terms of what may or may not be effective. Appropriate support may depend on aspects of the person (age, gender, personality) and the situation (type of stressor, degree of distress, time since the incident).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We are particularly interested in support that is aimed explicitly at immediately reducing negative thoughts and feelings about the eliciting event or problem. We use the term 
        <em>positive reframing</em> to encompass verbal support that includes things like reassurances that the negative event is ultimately beneficial to the recipient’s growth, that improvement is very likely, and that the problem is minor and ultimately insignificant. This kind of support may be intended to be caring and helpful, but it may be perceived as dismissing or invalidating. Indeed, the literature indicates that the benefit of these support behaviors is mixed (e.g., 
        Clark et al., 1998; 
        Dunkel-Schetter et al., 1992; 
        Lehman &amp; Hemphill, 1990; 
        Jones &amp; Burleson, 1997), varying according to circumstance (e.g., illness severity), time passed since the eliciting event, and other unknown individual differences. We suggest that self-esteem is one individual difference variable that can shed light on the relative helpfulness of this support strategy.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We use the term 
        <em>negative validation</em> to refer to support behaviors that communicate that the feelings, actions, or responses of the recipient are normal and appropriate to the situation; that express appreciation for the recipient’s predicament or for the difficulty of the situation; and that give assurance that expression of negative emotions is permissible and understandable. This kind of support is nearly always experienced as helpful (
        Burleson, 2003a; 
        Burleson, 2009; 
        Holmstrom &amp; Burleson, 2011; 
        Servaty-Seib &amp; Burleson, 2007). Note that we are conceptualizing negative validation as reflecting 
        <em>understanding</em> (one is aware of how one’s partner sees the situation) rather than 
        <em>agreement</em> (one shares one’s partner’s assessment; 
        Reis &amp; Shaver, 1988). For example, if a student receives a poor mark on an essay and feels incompetent about his or her writing skills, negative validation would mean that the provider acknowledges that the recipient feels incompetent but does not agree that the recipient is indeed incompetent. Of importance, perceived partner responsiveness is theorized to depend on understanding and not on agreement (
        Reis &amp; Clark, 2013).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We predict that LSEs and individuals with high self-esteem (HSEs) will be equally receptive to negative validation support but that LSEs will be less receptive than HSEs to positive reframing support. As well, LSEs will be less receptive to positive reframing support than to negative validation support, given that the former is inconsistent with their self-verification and mood regulation goals.</p><a id="psp-107-1-56-EKDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_14" title="The Role of Recipient’s Self-Esteem in Social Support Preferences">The Role of Recipient’s Self-Esteem in Social Support Preferences</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Some studies have shown that that higher self-esteem is associated with perceptions of more available social support (
        Lakey &amp; Cassady, 1990; 
        Sarason, Sarason, &amp; Pierce, 1990; 
        Vinokur, Schul, &amp; Caplan, 1987) and of more responsive and satisfying support from friends and family (
        Marigold, Cavallo, Holmes, &amp; Wood, 2013). Although these findings may result in part from LSEs receiving less objectively beneficial and responsive support, we suspected that LSEs would interpret the very same support messages differently than do HSEs based on their goals in a support interaction (cf. 
        Collins &amp; Feeney, 2004). There is a strong theoretical basis, stemming from self-verification theory and mood regulation research, for predicting that LSEs and HSEs would have different goals in an interaction in which they are sharing a negative experience.
      </p><a id="psp-107-1-56-EAKDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Self-Verification and Mood Regulation</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">According to self-verification research, people act to maintain their views of themselves even if those views are unfavorable. People pay more attention to information that is consistent with their self-views than to information that is inconsistent, and they behave in ways that elicit self-verifying reactions from interaction partners (see 
          Swann, 2012, for a review). Although people with relatively negative self-views might experience positive affect toward interaction partners who provide self-enhancing feedback, they seem to prefer interacting with self-verifying partners (
          Kwang &amp; Swann, 2010). Those partners convey understanding and validation, which suggests that the listener recognizes and appreciates core aspects of the self (
          Laurenceau, Barrett, &amp; Pietromonaco, 1998; 
          Reis &amp; Shaver, 1988).
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">What might self-verification motives mean for people’s social support preferences? We suspect that LSEs respond more favorably to interaction partners whose support messages are consistent, rather than inconsistent, with their relatively negative self-views (see also 
          Swann &amp; Brown, 1990). When providers offer negative validation, they convey an understanding and acceptance of the negative thoughts and feelings associated with the recipient’s experience, leaving LSEs with the sense that the provider is in touch with who they are. In contrast, HSEs should respond more favorably than do LSEs to interaction partners who use positive reframing, focusing on the potentially positive outcomes of a failure (e.g., learning something, new opportunities). A failure or rejection is not consistent with their self-view, so they are more confident that their failure will not be repeated and thus more comfortable with providers who express an optimistic outlook for them.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Self-esteem also moderates the extent to which people seek to reduce their negative emotions. When experiencing negative affect, HSEs attempt to counteract these feelings by bringing to mind personal strengths and positive thoughts and memories, whereas LSEs remain mired in the negative experience (
          Dodgson &amp; Wood, 1998; 
          Smith &amp; Petty, 1995). Moreover, LSEs explicitly express lower motivation than HSEs to repair negative moods, even though they know how to do so (
          Heimpel, Wood, Marshall, &amp; Brown, 2002; 
          Wood, Heimpel, Manwell, &amp; Whittington, 2009). When they are in good moods, LSEs are more likely than HSEs to want to dampen them (
          Wood, Heimpel, &amp; Michela, 2003). Because LSEs see good feelings as undeserved, atypical, and potentially disappointing (
          Wood et al., 2009), LSEs may be uncomfortable and motivated to avoid them.
        </p><a id="psp-107-1-56-EJDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_21" title="Obstacles to Effective Support Provision">Obstacles to Effective Support Provision</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In this paper we adopt the perspective of several other theorists that support is most beneficial when it matches the specific needs or goals of the distressed individual, in ways that indicate that the provider is attuned to and understands the recipient (
        Cavallo &amp; Higgins, 2013; 
        Cutrona, Cohen, &amp; Igram, 1990; 
        Cutrona &amp; Russell, 1990; 
        Cutrona, Shaffer, Wesner, &amp; Gardner, 2007; 
        Horowitz et al., 2001; 
        Sarason et al., 1990). Given people’s preferences for self-verifying feedback and LSEs’ reluctance to immediately repair a negative mood, we predicted that LSEs would perceive positive reframing support as less responsive than HSEs do, as well as less responsive than LSEs consider negative validation support to be. Support that is perceived as responsive—that is, demonstrating understanding, validation, and caring of the recipient (
        Reis &amp; Shaver, 1988)—has beneficial effects on emotions, coping, and relationship quality, whereas unresponsive support can have detrimental effects (
        Burleson, 2003a; 
        Burleson &amp; MacGeorge, 2002; 
        Feeney &amp; Collins, 2003; 
        Maisel &amp; Gable, 2009; 
        Reis &amp; Shaver, 1988; see also 
        Reis &amp; Clark, 2013, for a review).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Recipients’ perceptions of the responsiveness of support often falls short of the provider’s intention to be responsive (
        Gable, Gosnell, Maisel, &amp; Strachman, 2012), and people experiencing a major crisis or chronic stressful condition are sometimes surprised to find that support is not as abundant or as skillful as they expected (
        Dunkel-Schetter &amp; Bennett, 1990). Why are support providers not meeting expectations? For one, providers and recipients may disagree about the meaning and helpfulness of a behavior that was intended to be supportive (
        Dunkel-Schetter et al., 1992; 
        Sarason et al., 1990). Second, providers may hold incorrect assumptions about the helpfulness of various kinds of support. For example, they may believe that it is always healthier to encourage distressed individuals to be cheerful and optimistic about their circumstances than to allow these individuals to focus and elaborate on negative emotions.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">However, even when providers do seem to know what would be most helpful to support a friend in a particular crisis, they do not always follow through when actually faced with such a friend (
        Brown &amp; Geller, 2006; 
        Lehman, Ellard, &amp; Wortman, 1986). If the provider feels personally threatened or uncomfortable, his or her own negative emotions may interfere with skillful support provision (
        Dunkel-Schetter &amp; Bennett, 1990). In particular, providers find it more difficult to support relatively pessimistic individuals experiencing a stressful situation (
        Carver, Kus, &amp; Scheier, 1994; 
        Vollmann, Renner, &amp; Weber, 2007). We suspect that friends of LSEs may tire of their frequent expressions of negativity—which often seem out of proportion to the eliciting event—and thus be inclined to provide positive reframing even if they do not expect it to be received enthusiastically.
      </p><a id="psp-107-1-56-EIDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_26" title="Consequences of Ineffective Support for Providers">Consequences of Ineffective Support for Providers</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Although several attempts have been made to study when and for whom support responses may fail (e.g., 
        Dakof &amp; Taylor, 1990; 
        Lehman et al., 1986; 
        Lehman &amp; Hemphill, 1990), few if any have focused on the consequences that unsuccessful support interactions have for support providers. There is some evidence that the recipient’s acceptance or rejection of support will affect how the provider feels about the interaction, about the recipient, and about him- or herself (
        Barbee, Rowatt, &amp; Cunningham, 1998; 
        Karimiha, Rehman, &amp; MacDonald, 2013). Much of this research has focused on the upside of successful support interactions for providers. For example, providing support to others can increase positive mood and self-evaluations (
        Krause &amp; Shaw, 2000; 
        Williamson &amp; Clark, 1989) and one’s own relationship satisfaction (
        Collins &amp; Feeney, 2000; 
        Iida, Seidman, Shrout, Fujita &amp; Bolger, 2008). More broadly, the sense that one “matters” to others (i.e., that relationship partners depend on one for advice and support) is positively correlated with self-esteem (
        Elliott, Kao &amp; Grant, 2004) and predicts decreases in depressive symptoms over time for women (
        Taylor &amp; Turner, 2001).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In the current line of research we explore the downside of unsuccessful support interactions for providers. We speculate that, when faced with a recipient who does not embrace the support one offers, one may experience negative emotions and self-evaluations. This can have important consequences for future support as well. More than one unsuccessful support attempt may lead providers to believe that they are a generally ineffective caregiver and hesitate to continue offering support. Indeed, people feel more positively about supporting others when they see their support leading to noticeable improvements in the recipient’s situation (
        Dunkel-Schetter &amp; Bennett, 1990).
      </p><a id="psp-107-1-56-EHDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_30" title="Overview of Studies">Overview of Studies</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In this paper, we argue that the self-esteem of support recipients plays a key role in how they respond to support for negative experiences, and their reactions will in turn significantly affect the providers’ feelings about the interaction and about their friendship more generally. To our knowledge, the influence of self-esteem on receptivity to support behaviors that fall under the category of positive reframing has not been examined previously. As well, the present studies are among the few published studies that illuminate how the support provider may also be negatively affected by an unsuccessful support interaction.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In Studies 1–3 we provide evidence that, in comparison to HSEs, LSEs respond equally well to negative validation but less well to positive reframing. In Study 3 we also show that support providers have limited knowledge of their friends’ level of self-esteem and corresponding support preferences. In Study 4 we show that providers acknowledge that positive reframing is generally less helpful to LSEs than to HSEs, but they are no less likely to intend to provide it to LSEs. In Studies 5 and 6, we document the consequences for providers of providing the “wrong” kind of support to LSEs. We show that, in a real support interaction, providers engage in positive reframing with both LSEs and HSEs, but they are less likely to provide negative validation to LSEs. LSEs, in turn, are less accepting of the support they receive from their friends, and these friends feel worse about the interaction, about themselves, and about their friendship than do the providers of friends with high self-esteem (Study 5). In Study 6, we confirm that the experience of having one’s support offering rejected influences providers’ evaluations of both themselves and their friendships. We suggest that giving relationship partners the kind of support that best matches their individual preferences and interaction goals benefits both recipient and provider.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Of importance, we use a range of methods to capture this phenomenon: hypothetical scenarios (Studies 1, 4, and 6), an interaction with a confederate (Study 2), reports of recently received support (Study 3), and an interaction with a friend (Study 5).</p><a id="psp-107-1-56-EGDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_35" title="Study 1">Study 1</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In Study 1 we investigated how high and low self-esteem participants differ in their responses to hypothetical support scenarios involving failure or rejection experiences. Given that LSEs tend to overgeneralize the negative implications of failure (
        Brown &amp; Dutton, 1995; 
        Kernis, Brockner, &amp; Frankel, 1989) and rejection (
        Sommer &amp; Baumeister, 2002) for the self, we thought these events would activate self-verification concerns and thus highlight the influence of self-esteem on social support goals.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">All participants read the same three scenarios, but in one condition participants imagined receiving positive reframing support from their friend, whereas in the other condition, they imagined receiving negative validation support. We hypothesized that LSEs and HSEs would view both types of support similarly positively (i.e., understanding that their friend’s intentions were good). However, LSEs would perceive the positive reframing support to be less self-verifying and responsive than HSEs perceive positive reframing or than LSEs perceive the negative validation support, and this would subsequently influence their ratings of the friendship overall.</p><a id="psp-107-1-56-ECGDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Participants and procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">One hundred thirteen undergraduate students participated in an online study about social support in exchange for course credit.

The scenarios involved doing poorly on a midterm, being rejected by their romantic partner, and having a generally bad day (e.g., slipping on a patch of ice, missing a favorite television show). The first two scenarios implicated the self with room to interpret the event as a personal failure, and the last scenario was included so we could compare responses to receiving support for an event in which the self was less relevant.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><em>Manipulation</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">For each scenario, participants in the positive reframing condition (

I’m sure you’ll do better next time’”). Participants in the negative validation condition (
              <em>N</em> = 57) were told, for each scenario, “Your friend wants to assure you he/she understands what you’re going through and your feelings are normal.” This was followed by a statement of negative validation appropriate to the scenario (e.g., “So he/she replies, ‘That’s an awful feeling isn’t it?

From these 15 items, four subscales were calculated: negative reaction (four items, α = .77; e.g., “My friend’s response makes me feel worse,” “My friend’s response is disappointing”); positive reaction (four items, α = .87; e.g., “My friend’s response was intended to make me feel good,” “My friend’s response shows he/she truly believes I will do better next time”); self-verification (four items, α = .88; e.g., “My friend’s response makes me more sure of myself,” “My friend’s response doesn’t fit with who I am” [reverse-scored]); and perceived responsiveness (three items, α = .88; “My friend’s response lets me know he or she cares about me,” “My friend’s response shows that he or she understands the way that I’m feeling”). Although the last three subscales were highly correlated, we opted to analyze them separately. Our rationale for this was to be able to demonstrate that LSEs may recognize that positive reframing support is well-intentioned (i.e., the positive reaction subscale), yet still perceive it to be less responsive and self-verifying than negative validation.

            Preacher, Rucker, &amp; Hayes, 2007, Model 2). LSEs’ ratings of how self-verifying the negative validation support was relative to the positive reframing support significantly mediated their ratings of friendship quality in the negative validation condition relative to the positive reframing condition (point estimate = −.095, 95% bias-corrected and accelerated confidence interval [BCa CI] of −.205 to −.033). Among HSEs, however, this mediation effect was not significant (point estimate = −.008, 95% BCa CI of −.083 to .052). That is, results were consistent with the view that perceiving more self-verification from their friends’ negative validation in the hypothetical scenarios led LSEs (but not HSEs) to rate their friendships more positively.
          </p><a id="psp-107-1-56-EAGDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Discussion</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Results of the study supported our hypotheses. When imagining receiving support for personal failures, LSEs found positive reframing support significantly less responsive and self-verifying than the negative validation support, which mediated the subsequent effect on LSEs’ lower ratings of their friendship quality in the positive reframing condition. These effects were not found for the bad day scenario. Although this result might possibly be an artifact of the particular scenarios used in this study, it is consistent with self-verification theory because self-views come into play more when considering poor performance or romantic rejection, rather than random back luck.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Of importance, LSEs had similar levels of positive and negative thoughts as did HSEs regardless of what type of support they imagined. That is, LSEs were not any less likely than HSEs to believe that positive reframing was intended to make them feel good or that their friend was truly optimistic about the recipients’ future. This helps rule out an alternative explanation for LSEs’ lower receptiveness to positive reframing: namely, that they suspect the provider is being purposely dismissive or inauthentic. Similarly, people with negative self-views often experience positive affect toward interaction partners who provide self-enhancing feedback, though they prefer interacting with self-verifying partners (
          Kwang &amp; Swann, 2010). We return to this point in Studies 2 and 5, in which participants received support in a live interaction.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">It is noteworthy that although participants imagined support scenarios that were purely hypothetical, doing so affected their current ratings of their relationships with their closest friends. This result may attest to the power of using hypothetical scenarios in this context. We see similar findings in Study 6. At the same time, we recognize that responses to hypothetical scenarios may not accurately reflect individuals’ reactions to a real support attempt.

We expected that HSEs would be equally responsive to positive reframing and negative validation but that LSEs would show a clear preference for negative validation. By coding the interactions we could investigate the actual behaviors that LSEs display when support is perceived to be more or less responsive to their needs.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In this study participants shared a failure experience with a confederate whom they were told was another participant. The confederate was trained to respond with either negative validation (consistent with LSEs’ self-verification and mood regulation goals) or positive reframing (inconsistent with LSEs’ self-verification and mood regulation goals). Our hypotheses were that the confederate would find it easier to positively reframe the failure for HSEs than for LSEs (as corroborated by outside observers), and the LSEs would like the confederate more when she engaged in negative validation rather than when she engaged in positive reframing.</p><a id="psp-107-1-56-ECFDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Participants and procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Forty-five female participants signed up for a study of “sharing personal events with others” in exchange for course credit.

              <em>N</em> = 20) the participant’s experience. In the negative validation condition, the confederate was told, “Your goal is to validate the negative aspects of the participants’ experience. Go along with anything negative they have to say about it, for example, ‘that really sucks,’ ‘I’d feel pretty bad if that happened to me too,’ ‘you must have had a hard time dealing with that.’” In the positive reframing condition, the confederate was told, “Your goal is to try and cheer the participants up and turn their negative experience into a positive one. Counteract anything negative the participants say about their experience, for example, ‘that’s not so bad,’ ‘you’ll do better next time,’ ‘at least you learned something.’” We trained the confederate by giving her some written examples of failures and suggesting what she might say in each condition. A research assistant then shared different examples of failures, and we watched the confederate practice responding to the assistant until we were confident that she could fully make the distinction between the two support approaches.

Negative validation is more consistent with LSEs’ self-verification and mood regulation goals than is positive reframing, and LSEs clearly had some resistance to the positive reframing support that the confederate picked up. This view was corroborated by outside observers, who noted that LSEs were less engaged in the interaction when they were receiving positive reframing than when they were receiving negative validation.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We had also hypothesized that LSEs would like the confederate less in the positive reframing condition, but this was not supported. Although the behavior of LSEs indicated different responses to the two types of support, they did not rate the confederate differently between conditions. Perhaps LSEs did not rate the positive reframing confederate negatively (even though behaviorally they responded more negatively to her) because they believed her support was well-intentioned and she simply did not know them well enough to provide responsive support. Because this study involved an interaction with a stranger, for whom there are different norms and expectations than there are in a support interaction with a friend, less disappointment is likely to occur. LSEs’ resistance to positive reframing may very well result in different behavioral expressions when interacting with a friend, which we will see in Study 5.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">HSEs did not appear to be affected by the manipulation. Though the positive reframing support was designed to make participants feel better, the negative validation support was not designed to make participants feel worse about their situation. In other words, the negative validation was not actively opposing HSEs’ natural inclinations as much as the positive reframing was opposing those of LSEs.</p><a id="psp-107-1-56-EEDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_110" title="Study 3">Study 3</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We had two main goals for Study 3: The first was to provide further evidence that LSEs find positive reframing support to be less responsive than do HSEs and to be less responsive than negative validation support. Study 1 showed that LSEs perceived positive reframing to be less self-verifying and responsive when imagining receiving it from a friend, and Study 2 showed that LSEs did not respond as well to positive reframing in a real interaction with a confederate in which support type was manipulated. Study 3 was an online dyad study in which we could assess both recipient and provider reports of receiving/providing positive reframing and negative validation in the past month. We tested our hypothesis that recipients who were LSEs would rate their support experience as more responsive to the extent that they received negative validation, as opposed to positive reframing, based on provider reports of their actual behavior. This study thus moves beyond hypothetical situations and individual perceptions of support to examine reactions in a dyadic context.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The second goal was to investigate providers’ knowledge of their friends’ support preferences. How accurate are providers in their beliefs about the kind of support that is helpful to their friends? We gathered data on providers’ beliefs of helpfulness and recipients’ perceptions of helpfulness for positive reframing, negative validation, and distraction (defined as trying to divert the recipient’s focus from the negative event altogether). It is important to understand what may limit providers’ ability to actually be responsive. Successful support may depend both on their knowledge, which we investigate in both Study 3 and Study 4, as well as their willingness, which we address more specifically in Studies 4 and 5.</p><a id="psp-107-1-56-ECEDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Participants and procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">One hundred and nineteen friendship pairs completed an online survey about “personality and social support.” One member of each pair was recruited from the undergraduate subject pool and received course credit for participating.

Indeed, our results showed that LSEs tended to report lower responsiveness to the extent that providers reported giving them positive reframing support. For recipients who were HSEs, providers’ reports of positive reframing had no effect on their perceived responsiveness. LSEs were particularly sensitive to receiving low levels of negative validation as well. All recipients reported lower responsiveness to the extent that they perceived less validation from their friends, but this drop was especially steep for LSEs; in fact, the effect of recipient self-esteem on perceived responsiveness was significant only among recipients who perceived low levels of validation. Recipients who reported high levels of validation from their friends perceived equally responsive support regardless of self-esteem.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">One question stemming from these finding is why the recipients’ perceived responsiveness was predicted by recipient self-esteem in combination with recipients’ (but not providers’) report of negative validation and providers’ (but not recipients’) report of positive reframing. One possibility is that negative validation is more in the heads of recipients—it is the extent to which one feels that one’s negativity was heard and accepted—whereas positive reframing is more indicative of the provider’s goal. Recipients may not be fully aware of the extent to which providers were actively trying to cheer them up, though they were certainly affected by it. This interpretation is highly speculative, however, and further research is required.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The second goal in Study 3 was to determine whether providers know what kind of support is helpful to their friends. Comparing recipients’ reports of what support strategies they find helpful to providers’ reports of what support strategies they believe to be helpful suggested limited accuracy, particularly for recipients who were LSEs. There were no associations between recipients’ and providers’ reports of the helpfulness of negative validation or positive reframing. Higher recipient self-esteem was associated with higher expected benefit from positive reframing according to recipients but not providers.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Consistent with past research (
          Lakey &amp; Cassady, 1990; 
          Sarason et al., 1990; 
          Vinokur et al., 1987), LSEs generally believed that less social support was available to them than did HSEs. There is likely an element of bias here, in that LSEs tend to underestimate the extent to which relationship partners care about them (
          Baumeister, Campbell, Krueger, &amp; Vohs, 2003; 
          Murray, Holmes, &amp; Collins, 2006), but our findings suggest there is an element of truth as well. Providers seem to have more trouble accurately intuiting the support needs of their LSE friends, making it more difficult to provide responsive support.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The correlational nature of this study limits our interpretation of the findings. However, the results are consistent with the five experimental studies—two of which manipulate positive reframing and negative validation support—reported in this paper.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">One thing that may limit providers’ understanding of what is responsive support is their difficulty in correctly estimating their friends’ level of self-esteem (recall there was a fairly modest correlation of .26 between recipients’ self-reported self-esteem and providers’ rating of recipients’ self-esteem). In Study 4, we asked participants to think about a prototypical high or low self-esteem friend to determine beliefs about the benefit of positive reframing and negative validation in low versus high self-esteem individuals and their intentions to provide corresponding support.</p><a id="psp-107-1-56-EDDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_153" title="Study 4">Study 4</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Findings from Studies 1–3 supported our contention that positive reframing is not the most responsive support strategy for LSEs. Study 3 also showed that providers may be limited in their ability to be responsive by their inaccuracy about their friends’ self-esteem and specific support preferences. We suspected that if focused on exemplars of high or low self-esteem individuals, providers may demonstrate better understanding of how support preferences differ according to the self-esteem of the recipient. However, even when armed with accurate knowledge, providers might not be willing to adapt their support strategy to low versus high self-esteem recipients. They may find LSEs’ expressions of negativity to be out of proportion to the eliciting event, repetitive, and frustrating, and thus they may be inclined to provide positive reframing even if they do not expect it to be received eagerly.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In Study 4 we examined whether providers can distinguish what kind of support is helpful for low versus high self-esteem friends and whether they would act in accordance with that knowledge. In these studies, hypothetical scenarios particularly suited our hypotheses: that providers believe LSEs do not benefit from positive reframing as much as HSEs but are no less likely to intend to provide such support.</p><a id="psp-107-1-56-ECDDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Participants and procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Three hundred ninety-eight undergraduate students participated in an online study about social support for course credit.

            <em>N</em> = 198) were told to “think of a friend who you believe to have low self-esteem. That is, think of a person that you know who seems to doubt him/herself often, seems insecure at times, and holds a somewhat negative opinion of him/herself.”

Results supported these hypotheses. Of importance, although providers believed that positive reframing was less helpful to LSEs than to HSEs, they were no less likely to report that they would provide it.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We were unsure of how providers would view the distraction strategy, because recipients may recognize this as well-intentioned regardless of whether they find it helpful and as such not give clear feedback to providers about its usefulness.

In Study 5 we examined LSEs’ resistance to positive reframing, providers’ actual likelihood of providing positive reframing (and negative validation) to low and high self-esteem individuals differentially, and the consequences for providers of offering relatively nonresponsive support.</p><a id="psp-107-1-56-ECDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_176" title="Study 5">Study 5</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In Study 5, one member of a friendship dyad discussed a success or failure experience while the other member provided support in a face-to-face interaction. This paradigm enabled us to investigate three main questions:</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">1. What kind of support do providers typically give to low and high self-esteem friends? We hypothesized that, although LSEs prefer a different kind of support than do HSEs (Studies 1–3) and providers have some understanding of this (Study 4), with the subtle pressures of a real interaction providers may be less likely to offer negative validation to LSEs and more likely to downplay or positively reframe their negative feelings. If the thoughts that LSEs express about their failures seem blown out of proportion with the event or attributed to overly internal and stable causes, it may be hard for providers to avoid trying to address those “errors” in thinking. Further, providers may resist allowing LSEs’ negative thoughts and feelings to pervade the conversation—even though that may be what the LSEs want—in a misguided effort to reassure LSEs.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">2. How do LSEs respond to positive reframing support in an interaction with a friend? We hypothesized that they would indicate lower acceptance of the provider’s assertions and reassurances verbally but that they would not do so behaviorally by disengaging from the conversation as they did in Study 2. They may not disengage from an interaction with a friend who provides nonresponsive support as they do with a stranger (Study 2) because they are more invested in the relationship.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">3. How do providers feel when their support offering is not readily accepted by the recipient? We hypothesized that providers’ perceptions of an unsuccessful interaction will have a pervasive negative influence on their feelings about themselves, about the interaction, and about their relationship with their friend more generally. We also looked at whether supporting an LSE friend could be depleting. In other research, participants who interacted with a confederate who was trained to respond pessimistically to the participants’ suggestions for improving his or her difficult situation exhibited depleted resources on a subsequent task requiring self-control (compared to a condition in which the confederate was more receptive to suggestions; 
        Finkel et al., 2006, Study 4).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We contrasted the failure-sharing condition with a success-sharing condition to demonstrate that interacting with LSEs is not always more difficult than interacting with HSEs. Self-report and behavioral coding measures were used to assess support providers’ and recipients’ thoughts, feelings, and behaviors during the interaction. We expected that supporting LSEs for failures would result in more negative outcomes than would supporting HSEs for failures or supporting LSEs for successes.</p><a id="psp-107-1-56-ECCDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Participants and procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Fifty-two pairs of friends (104 participants) signed up for a study on “sharing personal events with friends” in exchange for course credit (if they were in an eligible undergraduate psychology course) or for $5 cash (if they were not psychology students).

Observers’ coding of providers’ depletion as a function of condition and recipient self-esteem: Study 5.</em></span></p><a id="psp-107-1-56-EACDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Discussion</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">When LSEs shared a failure with their friends, they were less positive about the interaction, relative to other LSEs sharing a success and relative to HSEs sharing a failure. Their friends agreed: Providers who supported LSEs for failures were also less positive about the interaction. Coders who observed participants’ behavior on videotape revealed what seems to have occurred in these interactions to make them go poorly. When LSEs disclosed a failure experience, their friends were less validating of their statements (relative to the other conditions), perhaps in an effort to avoid further upsetting them (
          Lemay &amp; Dudley, 2011). Providers positively reframed LSEs’ negative statements about their failures just as much as they did HSEs, despite the findings of Studies 1–3, which suggested that LSEs respond less well to positive reframing than HSEs do, and Study 4, which indicated that providers understand that LSEs do not prefer it. In turn, the recipients who were LSEs were less accepting of the support offered by their providers.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">These results are consistent with the idea that LSEs’ self-verification and mood regulation goals make them more receptive to validating statements than to nonvalidating statements. Providers, perhaps frustrated that their efforts to comfort their LSE/failure friends were rebuffed, subsequently reported more negative ratings of the interaction, lower positive mood, lower perceived regard, and lower ratings of the quality of their friendship. This difficult interaction also made them show signs of depletion.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Of interest, providers accurately perceived that the LSE recipients who shared failures would rate the interaction less positively, but those LSE recipients did not perceive that their providers would rate the interaction less positively. That is, only support providers, not recipients, demonstrated insight into how their partner would rate the interaction. Perhaps providers were more attuned to recipients because they were assigned to the caregiving role.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The effects in Study 5 were farther reaching for providers than for recipients. Although LSE recipients who shared failures also reported more negative interactions, there were no other downstream consequences for them (e.g., on mood, perceived regard, relationship quality) as there were for providers. Why might this have been so? One possibility is that recipients may recognize that the provider has altruistic intentions even when the support message is actually unhelpful (
          Dunkel-Schetter et al., 1992; 
          Lehman &amp; Hemphill, 1990), and thus they may not take unsuccessful support interactions to heart. This explanation is also consistent with the results obtained in Study 1, in which LSEs rated positive reframing support as less self-verifying and responsive than negative validation but as no less well intended, as well as Study 2, in which LSEs who received positive reframing from a confederate responded more poorly in their behavior but did not evaluate the confederate less positively.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Another possibility is that the situation was more socially risky for providers, who felt they were being judged on how well they were doing in their support role and were thus more deeply affected by the progress of the interaction. Indeed, providers showed evidence of risk regulation processes (
          Murray et al., 2006); when feeling worse about themselves, they derogated their friendship. Recipients, in contrast, were in a less risky situation; the instructions mandated that the provider offer them support, so they had less reason to be concerned about negative evaluation.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Finally, it may be that the emotional impact of describing these past experiences was less than it would be in a context where people discuss either ongoing or very recent problems, and the wounds of failure are still fresh in their minds. If the emotional experience was more immediate and salient, support attempts might have had a more observable effect on recipients’ moods and relationship evaluations as well. Our finding that LSEs seemed less receptive to positive reframing support even when their failures were more distant memories (
          <em>M</em> = 4.6 months ago) suggests that this phenomenon may be even more powerful than we observed here.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In summary, our explanation for these findings has three parts: When recipients discussed failures, providers were less likely to validate the negative thoughts and feelings expressed by LSEs; yet LSEs prefer validating support and so were less accepting of providers’ more positively framed support; providers’ support attempts were rejected, so they were frustrated and disappointed, and they ultimately took the unsuccessful interaction to heart. At least two other alternative explanations are possible, however. One possibility is that LSEs made the interaction unpleasant because they were afraid of being evaluated negatively when sharing a failure. Contrary to this possibility, however, there was no effect on recipients’ ratings of the support provider’s regard for them. Another alternative explanation is that LSEs shared worse failures than HSEs did, and this made the interaction more difficult and uncomfortable. However, there were no self-esteem differences on how negative recipients (or coders) believed their failures were, how recent they were, or in what domain (school, relationships, etc.) they occurred.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Study 4 demonstrated that people have some knowledge of which support strategies benefit LSEs versus HSEs. Why, then, did providers not put this knowledge to full use in Study 5? One possibility is that they were inaccurate about their friend’s level of self-esteem. The correlations between self-reported self-esteem and friend’s estimates was .26 in Study 3 (similar to the .20 correlation found by 
          Vazire, 2010), which leaves enough inaccuracy to lead providers astray in their choice of support strategy. Another possibility is that abstract judgments about LSEs’ preferred strategies may be less influential than the immediate and pressing urge to alleviate the distress of a friend in a face-to-face interaction. When the distress and negativity seem out of proportion to the eliciting event in the providers’ mind, it may be particularly difficult for the provider to hold back on using a positive reframing strategy.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">One unexpected finding was that providers of HSEs reported more positive affect and higher relationship quality when HSEs shared failures compared to successes. We can think of two possible explanations: (a) friends felt especially good about being able to effectively support HSEs in difficult times, or (b) friends felt good seeing HSEs taken down a notch (the experience of schadenfreude; 
          Smith, Powell, Combs, &amp; Schurtz, 2009). Further research is needed to disentangle these possibilities.

We speculate that these downstream consequences for the provider occurred as a result of having their support rebuffed, as noted by coders.

There are numerous aspects of the recipient’s personality and of the situation that interact to influence the kind of support message that will be perceived by the recipient as most helpful and responsive. Although one can rarely go wrong with support strategies like expressing care and concern, or acknowledging the recipient’s feelings and difficulty of the situation, many other strategies yield mixed outcomes. Focusing on the bright side of the negative event, minimizing the seriousness of the situation, and expressing confidence in the recipient’s ability to improve the situation may be appreciated or may be perceived as insensitive and even harmful (
        Clark et al., 1998; 
        Jones &amp; Burleson, 1997; 
        Lehman &amp; Hemphill, 1990). In fact, 
        Burleson (2003a) argued that “given the mixed outcomes associated with these emotional support strategies, helpers probably should avoid using them unless they are quite confident about their appropriateness in a particular situation” (p. 567). The present research illuminates one variable that influences preferred support strategies—the recipient’s self-esteem—as well as documents the consequences for providers of an unsuccessful support interaction.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The results of six studies converge to show that supporting individuals with low self-esteem can be a difficult experience for both parties when support aims to positively reframe negative experiences. In contrast, when providers offer support that validates LSEs’ negative thoughts and feelings (and supports their self-verification and mood regulation goals), such interactions appear to be more successful. Study 1 showed that LSEs found positive reframing to be significantly less self-verifying and responsive than negative validation, which mediated their lower evaluation of their friendship with the provider more generally. Study 2 showed that LSEs were less behaviorally engaged in a support interaction in which they received positive reframing than when they received negative validation from a confederate. Study 3 showed that LSEs believed they had received less responsive support from a friend in recent months, to the extent that they reported receiving lower validation and to the extent that their friend reported providing more positive reframing. Providers’ beliefs about what kind of support was helpful to their friend were low in accuracy, particularly for LSE friends. Study 4 showed that providers have some knowledge that trying to positively reframe LSEs’ negative feelings about a failure or rejection experience would be less helpful than it would be for HSEs, yet they intended to provide positive reframing equally for both. Following this behavioral prediction, Study 5 showed that providers were indeed no less likely to offer positive reframing to LSE friends in a real interaction; in fact, they were less likely to negatively validate LSEs than HSEs who related a failure experience. Providers charged with the task of supporting an LSE friend for a failure reported that the interaction went more poorly and took this unsuccessful interaction to heart. Study 6 confirmed that the experience of having one’s support offering rejected can directly influence not only one’s perceptions about the support interaction but feelings about oneself and about the relationship more generally. These results demonstrate that LSEs are not always difficult to interact with. One’s own treatment of them plays a large role.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Independent coding of providers’ behavior in Study 5 showed that providers were also more depleted after trying to support an LSE friend who shared a failure. This conceptually replicates the 
        Finkel et al. (2006) finding that participants exhibited evidence of depletion (decreased persistence on a handgrip task) after a support interaction with a relatively pessimistic and nonreceptive confederate. Although we do not have such a direct measure of depletion in the current studies, this finding seems important to follow up. When self-regulatory resources are depleted, providers may have trouble remaining patient with the recipient and inhibiting criticism. As well, if providers lose motivation (such as after repeated failed attempts), they may offer less support or less effective support in the future (
        Collins, Guichard, Ford, &amp; Feeney, 2006).
      </p><a id="psp-107-1-56-ECADA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Theoretical Implications</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The present findings highlight the influence of mood regulation goals on interpersonal relationships. Most of the existing research has focused on the intrapersonal effects of regulating affective states, such as how long one’s moods linger afterward (e.g., 
          Wood et al., 2009). The present data, in contrast, indicate that pursuing mood regulation goals can alter relationships with close others. In these studies, frustrated attempts to provide LSEs with mood-enhancing social support led providers to make more negative evaluations of the interaction and of the relationship itself. If such interactions occur repeatedly, well-meaning but frustrated partners may give up and abandon LSE friends when they are most in need.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Our data also provide support for and novel insight into self-verification theory. Both recipients’ and providers’ interaction quality suffered when providers made support attempts that were incongruent with LSEs’ self-views. This finding helps elucidate a seemingly paradoxical aspect of self-verification work; namely, that LSEs prefer to enter and maintain social relationships with those who verify their negative self-views (
          Swann, De La Ronde, &amp; Hixon, 1994; 
          Swann, Wenzlaff, Krull, &amp; Pelham, 1992). That LSEs in our studies were more receptive to support that reinforced their negative disclosures suggests that LSEs may prefer self-verifying partners not only because they prefer to be viewed negatively on a cognitive basis (or at least less positively than HSEs do). Rather, LSEs may also prefer self-verifying partners because they provide support for LSEs’ mood regulation goals. In social support situations, self-verifying partners are more instrumental to LSEs’ mood regulation goals because negative validation facilitates their apparent goal to maintain that emotional state, rather than to “snap out of it” too quickly (
          Wood et al., 2009). Because LSEs prefer to maintain rather than to repair their negative mood, at least at first, they may be particularly drawn to others who help them fulfill these regulatory objectives (
          Fitzsimons &amp; Shah, 2008). Thus, LSEs may feel particularly “safe” with self-verifying partners not only because there is little risk of disappointing them but also because self-verifying partners facilitate their goals in the domain of mood regulation as well.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Additionally, one explanation put forth for why LSEs tend to be more intimate with self-verifying relationship partners (e.g., 
          Swann et al., 1994) is that people tend to exit relationships with partners whose evaluations of them are more positive than their own (
          Swann, 2012). Although this is likely often the case, it may sometimes be the partners of LSEs who dissolve the relationship. That is, if support providers have positive evaluations and offer consolation that is consistent with these attitudes—that is, they positively reframe the LSE’s negative disclosures—the distress they then experience may spur them to leave their partners despite holding otherwise favorable views of them. Thus, people not only may contribute directly to a self-verifying social reality but also may do so in oblique ways through their behavior during social support interactions.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Broadly, the present research adds to growing evidence that tailoring social support is critical in making it effective. Just as support that matches situational demands is highly beneficial (e.g., 
          Cutrona et al., 1990, 
          2007; 
          Sarason et al., 1990), support attempts that are adapted to recipients’ personalities and goals may also enhance the quality and success of these interactions (
          Simpson, Winterheld, Rholes, &amp; Orina, 2007; see also 
          Veenstra et al., 2011). Furthermore, recipients’ self-esteem is liable to influence how serious, difficult, or uncontrollable recipients perceive the stressful situation to be, so it should be accounted for in a model of matching support. Together, these findings suggest that it is important for providers to identify and understand what recipients desire and to alter support attempts accordingly. Tailoring social support may ensure high-quality and effective support interactions as well as more solid relationship bonds.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Other research has shown that acts of support intended to relieve recipients’ distress may actually increase that distress. Both experiments and daily diary studies show that support is most effective when it is invisible to recipients; that is, when they do not notice or do not interpret their relationship partner’s behavior as an act of support (
          Bolger &amp; Amarel, 2007; 
          Bolger et al., 2000; 
          Gleason, Iida, Shrout, &amp; Bolger, 2008). In fact, directly perceiving one’s partner’s behavior as a support attempt is sometimes associated with an increase in negative emotions (compared to perceiving no support). It is thought that visible support may communicate a sense of inefficacy to recipients (i.e., that they are in some way weak and unable to handle the stressful situation alone).
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We suspect that another reason emotional support may have detrimental effects is that it may make some recipients feel invalidated if it is perceived as dismissing or trivializing the recipient’s concerns (e.g., “Don’t worry, you’ll do fine in the job interview! I know you’re smart”). Although such a response is inherently positive and is intended to convey faith in the recipient’s abilities, it may suggest to some (especially LSEs) that their anxiety about the upcoming event is unfounded and that their relationship partner does not truly understand or accept their feelings (
          Silver &amp; Wortman, 1980). And in fact, visible support is beneficial to the extent that is perceived as responsive to the recipient’s needs (
          Maisel &amp; Gable, 2009).
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">At the same time, it may be difficult for providers to give the support that LSEs prefer. Validating LSEs’ negative moods may be distressing because providers wish their friends to be happier and because they may “catch” the LSE’s negative mood through mood contagion processes (
          Neumann &amp; Strack, 2000). Over time, the cost of providing social support to a person with LSE may make people less likely to offer such support in times of need. Previous research has indicated that such costs tend to inhibit empathy and to motivate avoidance behavior (
          Shaw, Batson, &amp; Todd, 1994). The ironic consequence of such processes is that LSEs’ previously unwarranted beliefs about their relationship partners’ responsiveness to negative self-disclosures may be confirmed if partners evade support situations. Thus, LSEs’ mood regulation goals may contribute to the reciprocal link between their doubts about others’ caring and their partners’ eventual rejecting behavior.
        </p><a id="psp-107-1-56-EBADA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Limitations and Future Directions</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The present studies offer insight into one of the reasons that providing responsive social support can be so challenging, and they are among the first to document the far-ranging consequences for providers of an unsuccessful support interaction. Yet, there are many questions that remain unanswered. Social support preferences and behaviors are influenced by a myriad of personal and situational factors that interact in complex ways. Nonetheless, we believe the studies reported here make an important contribution to the literature and are worthy of further follow-up.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">What counts as sensitive, effective support may differ as a function of demographic factors such as gender (
          Burleson, 2003b). The female role, which emphasizes nurturance and emotional expressiveness, makes it easier to both give and receive social support (
          Barbee et al., 1993). The number of men participating in the current studies was too small to meaningfully detect gender differences, but this is something to be explored in future studies.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Timing may also prove to be a significant factor (
          Jacobson, 1986). Offering the “right” support at the wrong time may undermine the effectiveness of providers’ efforts (
          Neff &amp; Karney, 2005; 
          Rafaeli &amp; Gleason, 2009). It remains to be seen whether LSEs may be more receptive to positive reframing after a certain period of time since the eliciting event has passed, or when they feel that their negative thoughts and feelings have already been sufficiently validated. Even within the span of a 10-minute interaction, needs may change as the recipient comes to feel understood, takes on a new perspective, develops a plan of action, and so on.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Although we know that LSEs report lower perceptions of the availability and responsiveness of social support generally (
          Lakey &amp; Cassady, 1990; 
          Marigold et al., 2013), we do not know for certain whether they actually receive less or, instead, lower quality support. Study 1 showed that LSEs and HSEs extracted different implications from the very same messages of support, so perception certainly plays a role. On the other hand, it is possible that because LSEs frequently express negativity, any individual negative disclosure will seem less diagnostic of true distress and thus elicit less responsiveness from their partners (
          Forest, Kille, Wood, &amp; Holmes, 2013; 
          Forest &amp; Wood, 2012). Study 5 also supports the idea that the perception of less responsive support is not “all in their heads”; according to coders, LSEs in that study did in fact receive less negative validation for failures than did HSEs but no less positive reframing, despite the findings from Studies 1–3 that LSEs appreciated negative validation as much as HSEs but were less interested in receiving positive reframing. This is a preliminary study, however, and more work must be done to understand the experience of both LSEs and their support providers across a range of interactions. Future work will also delve further into understanding why providers may be reluctant to provide the kind of support that LSEs find responsive, even when they are aware of what this support looks like.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">One might wonder whether, in the long run, it is healthy for LSEs to continually receive the kind of support that allows them to stay focused on their negative thoughts and feelings. Indeed, rumination may lead to worse mood and greater symptoms of depression (
          Nolen-Hoeksema &amp; Morrow, 1993). However, thought suppression may also increase dysphoric affect and subsequently more rumination (
          Wenzlaff &amp; Luxton, 2003). We propose that providers may do well to use negative validation in a way that facilitates mindful acceptance of their LSE friends’ negative thoughts and feelings. Mindfulness-based approaches propose that it is the relation a person has with his or her current thoughts, and not the content of those thoughts, that is most critical for well-being (
          Segal, Williams, &amp; Teasdale, 2002). In fact, LSEs who were high in mindful acceptance showed less severe depressive symptoms than did LSEs who were low in mindful acceptance (
          Michalak, Teismann, Heidenreich, Strohle, &amp; Vocks, 2011). There is a vast literature on the use of mindfulness-based techniques by trained therapists; in future work we intend to examine the extent to which support providers may facilitate similar outcomes through use of negative validation support.

          Burleson, 2003a). Although providers must possess good interpersonal skills to facilitate a beneficial support interaction, we cannot underestimate the role of accurately appraising what is needed in a given situation by a particular support recipient (
          Dunkel-Schetter et al., 1992). One may not always be aware of the self-esteem level of one’s interaction partner or some of the details surrounding the circumstance that also influence type of support preferred. However, we suggest that people can increase their effectiveness at providing support if they stay present and attuned to the receptivity of their partner. If your attempt to point out the silver lining in your friend’s challenging employment situation is met with a sullen reminder of the prevailing dark cloud, you might do best to acknowledge the dark cloud and sympathize with the experience of working under it rather than point more emphatically to the silver lining.
