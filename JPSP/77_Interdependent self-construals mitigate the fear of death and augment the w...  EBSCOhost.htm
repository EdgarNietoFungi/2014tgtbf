However, individuals with interdependent self-construals, self-representations that reflect embeddedness with and connection to others, are able to extend themselves through time and space through their linkage to a larger social group. The present set of 5 experiments tested the hypotheses that individuals primed with an interdependent self-construal would fear death less and would be more willing to face harm for the sake of the group than individuals with an independent self-construal, that is, self-representations that reflect autonomy and independence from others (“I have self-control”). The results show that interdependent self-construals, compared to independent self-construals, attenuate death anxiety, reduce the avoidance of death, increase the approach to death-related stimuli, induce a greater willingness to become a martyr, and induce a greater willingness to sacrifice the self for other members of important groups.

        Becker, 1962; 
        Frankl, 1946/2000; 
        Maslow, 1943). 
        Maslow (1943), for example, placed self-actualization concerns at the apex of his motivational hierarchy. According to 
        Frankl (1946/2000), self-actualization is encapsulated in, and attained through, attempts to serve a cause higher than the self. In the field of positive psychology, researchers have found that the quest for meaning is central to authentic happiness and that it can be attained by attaching oneself to a larger cause (
        Seligman, 2002). 
        Becker (1973) and terror management theorists (e.g., 
        Greenberg, Solomon, Pyszczynski, 1997) noted that the ultimate threat to personal meaning is death, the prospect of non-existence and hence utter insignificance. To ward off the threat of personal insignificance, individuals are motivated to attach themselves to social groups, to defend the groups’ worldview (that lend members significance), and to act in service of their groups.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">A person who views the self as interdependent with others in the social group should experience less death anxiety than should a person who views the self independently because identification with a group fortifies one’s sense of self, hence boosting one’s perceived significance. While a person’s life may be temporary, a group can live on indefinitely. Through collective identification, a person is able to extend the self through space and time (
        Castano &amp; Dechesne, 2005). The more important group membership becomes, the more important the group’s 
        <em>existence</em> should become relative to the individual’s existence. Therefore, our first hypothesis is that thinking of the self 
        <em>interdependently</em>, as embedded in a group, as opposed to conceiving of the self 
        <em>independently</em>, as an unattached agent, should mitigate fears of death.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Attachment to a group may be strengthened by the individual’s willingness to act on the group’s behalf and to defend it against its enemies. Especially, the readiness to take personal risk and sacrifice one’s personal concerns on the group’s behalf may be richly rewarded by recognition and appreciation by the group, promising one a place in the group’s collective memory, and in this sense a kind of immortality (
        Kruglanski, Chen, Dechesne, Fishman, &amp; Orehek, 2009). Consistent with this idea is the notion offered by the philosopher 
        Daniel Dennett (2002), who stated that unlike other species, humans are willing to engage in “the subordination of . . . genetic interests to other interests.” Based on these considerations, our second hypothesis is that interdependent self-construal will increase one’s willingness to become a martyr and the readiness to engage in altruistic suicide (
        Durkheim, 1897/1997) than an independent self-construal.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In summary, the relation between the interdependent (vs. the independent) self-construal, fear of death and the readiness to sacrifice was explored in five experimental studies. Two complementary hypotheses were investigated: (1) an interdependent self-construal would lead to lower death anxiety than an independent self-construal, and (2) an interdependent self-construal would lead to a greater willingness to sacrifice the self for others than an independent self-construal.</p><a id="psp-107-2-265-EHDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_9" title="Preliminary Empirical Support">Preliminary Empirical Support</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Preliminary support for our hypotheses can be gleaned from research on social identity theory (
        Tajfel &amp; Turner, 1986), self-categorization theory (
        Turner, 1985), need for closure theory (
        Kruglanski &amp; Webster, 1996), terror management theory (
        Greenberg et al., 1997), and identity fusion theory (
        Swann, Gómez, Seyle, Morales, &amp; Huici, 2009). Each theory predicts that insecurity aroused by death anxiety will lead to greater identification with the in-group, and that individuals will be more willing to sacrifice the self for the sake of the group as group identifications becomes stronger. Importantly, though, while each of these approaches to the possible link between group identification and death are generally supportive of our hypotheses, they stop short of testing it directly. In this section, we review this evidence and explicate its limitations for the present hypotheses.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">According to social identity and self-categorization theories, in-group identifications constitute a central aspect of self-understanding with strong in-group identifications fostering clearly defined and positively valenced perception of the self. Therefore, experience of insecurity should increase the tendency to identify with collectives in order to reduce aversive uncertainty (
        Hogg, 2000). Preliminary evidence for these notions can be gleaned from laboratory studies which have found that inductions of uncertainty increase identification with cohesive groups (
        Hogg, Sherman, Dierselhuis, Maitner, &amp; Moffitt, 2007; 
        Reid &amp; Hogg, 2005). Similarly, theory related to the need for closure (
        Kruglanski &amp; Webster, 1996) suggests that feelings of insecurity should generate a motivation to reduce uncertainty (i.e., reach closure). When the need for closure is aroused, a tendency toward “group centrism” has emerged (
        Kruglanski, Pierro, Mannetti, &amp; De Grada, 2006), which includes identification with the in-group, striving for consensus, and derogation of out-groups. However, neither of these theories previously postulated a link between group identification and fear of death reduction specifically.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">According to terror management theory, the insecurity aroused when mortality is made salient should lead to in-group identification and defense of one’s worldview. Terror management research has consistently found that the threat of death increases group identification and worldview defense (e.g., 
        Greenberg, Pyszczynski, Solomon, Simon, &amp; Breus, 1994; 
        Greenberg, Simon, Porteus, Pyszczynski, &amp; Solomon, 1995; 
        Greenberg, Simon, Pyszczynski, Solomon, &amp; Chatel, 1992; 
        Greenberg et al., 1997; 
        McGregor et al., 1998; 
        Rosenblatt, Greenberg, Solomon, Pyszczynski, &amp; Lyon, 1989). Specifically, individuals from out-groups with worldviews that differed from the participant were derogated when mortality was made salient (vs. control), but participants who were either a member of the in-group 
        <em>or</em> who shared the participant’s worldview (or both) were evaluated favorably (See &amp; 
        Petty, 2006). Extending this research to the realm of martyrdom, among Iranian participants mortality salience manipulations have been found to increase the favorability of perceptions of other people who supported martyrdom on behalf of the perceiver’s in-group and to increase participants’ willingness to join the martyr’s cause (
        Pyszczynski et al., 2006). Among British participants, mortality salience manipulations have been found to increase the willingness to self-sacrifice for the sake of their nation as long as an alternative means of symbolic immortality was not provided (
        Routledge &amp; Arndt, 2008).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Testing the notion that the effects of mortality salience can be buffered by close personal relationships, Mikulincer and colleagues have consistently found that 
        <em>stable relationships</em> can mitigate the fear of death (e.g., 
        Mikulincer, Florian, Birnbaum, &amp; Malishkevich, 2002; 
        Mikulincer, Florian, &amp; Hirschberger, 2003). This work detailed specific conditions that must be met in order for significant others to reduce death anxiety. For example, 
        Mikulincer, Florian, and Tolmacz (1990) found that individuals with avoidant attachment styles scored higher on 
        Templer’s (1970) death anxiety measure than participants with secure or ambivalent attachment styles. Another way close relationships have been investigated in studies on death anxiety was to have participants imagine being separated from significant others. Specifically, 
        Mikulincer et al. (2002) wrote,

        
<blockquote>the experience of separation per se does not necessarily lead to death awareness. Mainly, when this separation implies a sustained or irreparable disruption of a close relationship, the individual may feel defenseless in denying the terror of his or her death and concerns about death may become more accessible. (p. 296)</blockquote></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">More closely tied to the current hypotheses, researchers have found that individual differences in perceptions of symbolic immortality are negatively correlated with death anxiety (
        Florian &amp; Mikulincer, 1998). Research has also found that intrinsic religiosity, which includes the internalization of religious teachings such as the belief in the afterlife, mitigates or alters the effects of mortality salience manipulations (
        Golec de Zavala, Cichocka, Orehek, &amp; Abdollahi, 2012; 
        Jonas &amp; Fischer, 2006; 
        Norenzayan, Dar-Nimrod, Hansen, &amp; Proulx, 2009).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In yet another line of research, researchers have investigated the role of identity fusion in willingness to fight and die for the group. As predicted, participants whose identities were strongly fused (vs. weakly fused) consistently reported greater willingness to kill and to die for the sake of the group (
        Swann, Gómez, Dovidio, Hart, &amp; Jetten, 2010). Preliminary evidence suggests that it is physiological arousal that augments the tendencies of highly fused participants to do so (
        Swann, Gómez, Huici, Morales, &amp; Hixon, 2010).
      </p><a id="psp-107-2-265-EGDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_17" title="The Present Research">The Present Research</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The research reviewed above, generated by influential psychological theories and conducted by diverse research groups, has consistently found that in-group identification increases in times of threat and that it then promotes the belief that self-sacrifice and martyrdom for the group’s cause are laudable and worthy. While this work is generally consistent with our hypotheses, its ability to inform our hypotheses is limited in two ways. First, in reliance on stable individual differences on the relevant dimensions (e.g., the degree of fusion with one’s group, one’s attachment style) such research has been mainly correlational; as such it does not address the hypothesized causal relation between interdependent self-construal and the reduction in death anxiety. Second, whereas previous research has typically focused on fusion with and defense of a 
        <em>specific</em> social group, the current theory suggests that a 
        <em>general orientation</em> toward interdependent self-construal is capable of reducing death anxiety. To our knowledge, the link between interdependent self-construal in its general sense and death-related thoughts has not yet been investigated.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Perhaps the research that has come closest to the present concerns is Mikulincer and colleagues’ work on attachment styles and death anxiety (
        Mikulincer et al., 1990, 
        2002). Yet, these authors’ concerns were with attachment styles that presumably cannot be altered via induction of interdependent or independent self-construals: Manipulations of interdependent self-construals would not be expected to reduce ambivalent attachment styles specifically, nor do they imply “a sustained or irreparable disruption of a close relationship.” In short, the general linkage between interdependent self-construal and death anxiety has not been examined thus far; hence it merits an investigation in its own right.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Accordingly, we conducted five experiments described in what follows. The first three experiments investigated whether priming an interdependent (vs. independent) self-construal causes a reduction in participants’ death anxiety (Experiments 1–3) and increases participants’ 
        <em>general</em> readiness to engage in acts of martyrdom (Experiment 3). The fourth experiment examined whether an interdependent self-construal increases participants’ 
        <em>specific</em> willingness to sacrifice themselves for the sake of others, members of an important group. Finally, the fifth experiment investigated whether an interdependent self-construal leads to an increase in the approach/avoidance of death-related stimuli. A detailed description of our experiments is given below.

To this end, participants were primed with either one or the other self-construal before completing a self-report measure of death anxiety.

The priming manipulation that we used was first developed by 
              Gardner, Gabriel, and Lee (1999). Participants were presented with a paragraph describing a trip to a city. Their task was to circle all the pronouns in the paragraph. The independent and interdependent versions differed only with respect to the pronouns used. Half the participants were assigned to the independent self-construal condition which used singular pronouns (e.g., 
              <em>I</em>, 
              <em>mine</em>). The other half of the participants were assigned to the interdependent self-construal condition which used plural pronouns (e.g., 
              <em>we</em>, 
              <em>ours</em>). A recent meta-analysis found that this is one of the most common manipulations and reliably induces independent versus interdependent self-construals (
              Oyserman &amp; Lee, 2008).

              Templer, 1970). This scale measures death anxiety by asking individuals about the extent to which they disagree or agree with 15 death-related statements (α = .62). For example, participants were asked to indicate the extent to which they disagreed or agreed with the statement “I am very much afraid to die.” Participants answered the questions on a 6-point Likert scale (1 = 
              <em>strongly disagree</em>, 6 = 
              <em>strongly agree</em>). A composite score was computed by reverse-scoring the appropriate items and then summing across the 15 responses.

          <em>M</em> = 47.75, 
          <em>SD</em> = 9.37) reported a lower death anxiety than participants primed with an independent self-construal (

To control for this possible influence, 
        Gaertner, Sedikides, and Graetz (1999, Study 4) modified the wording of their dependent measure so that the word “you” replaced the word “I.” Because the word “you” can refer to both a single person or to a group, Gaertner et al. reasoned that such a modification served as an appropriate check on such potential influences, and we followed their recommendation in our second experiment to ensure that our results were not simply due to responses biases.

First, we added a measure of willingness to become a martyr, which more directly tests the notion that an interdependent (vs. independent) self-construal would induce the readiness to self-sacrifice for the group. Second, to investigate whether it is the interdependent or the independent prime (or both) that affects martyrdom-readiness, in addition to the foregoing primes, we included in this study a no-prime control condition. We expected that the control condition and independent self-construal condition would not differ from each other because our American sample should already have predominantly an independent self-construal (e.g., 
        Markus &amp; Kitayama, 1991). Therefore, we expected the interdependent self-construal condition to differ from the control and independent self-construal conditions. Finally, we used a different manipulation of self-construal to examine whether our results generalize beyond the specific operation used in the first two experiments.

        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In summary, Experiment 5 found that self-construals influenced implicit behavioral tendencies to approach or avoid death. Specifically, it was found that action, pulling versus pushing, and self-construal, independent versus interdependent, influenced participants’ responses to death words (and not to control words). When pulling death words toward, independent participants were significantly slower to respond than interdependent participants; in contrast, when pushing death words away, independent participants were directionally quicker to respond than interdependent participants. The data also showed that independent participants were directionally slower to pull death words toward than push death words away; in contrast, the opposite was observed for interdependent participants, interdependent participants were marginally quicker to pull death words toward than push death words away (see 
          Figure 2). This pattern of data supports the idea that adopting an interdependent mindset, a mindset of embeddedness with others, prompts behavioral tendencies that facilitate acts of martyrdom and self-sacrifice.
        </p><a id="psp-107-2-265-EADA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_103" title="General Discussion">General Discussion</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">People perceive the self to be both separate (independent) from and connected (interdependent) to others (e.g., 
        Baumeister &amp; Leary, 1995; 
        Brewer &amp; Gardner, 1996; 
        Kühnen &amp; Oyserman, 2002). Whether one or the other self-construal will be adopted may depend on the situation. We capitalized on this affordance in all five of our experiments by experimentally priming either an independent or interdependent self-construal. The results consistently demonstrate that, compared to an independent self-construal, an interdependent one attenuates individuals’ anxiety about death (Experiments 1–3), fosters a greater willingness to sacrifice the self for a cause (Experiments 3 and 4), prompts lesser avoidance of death (Experiment 5), and greater willingness to approach death (Experiment 5). We have interpreted these findings to mean that interdependent self-construals afford individuals a sense of continual existence via attachment to an enduring group (
        Castano &amp; Dechesne, 2005); this may mitigate the fear of one’s own demise.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The present research goes beyond previous research by (a) investigating a general orientation toward interdependence rather than identification or fusion with a specific group, (b) investigating this linkage experimentally, and (c) investigating the direction of causality in which interdependent self-construals cause reduced death anxiety and increased self-sacrifice. Research motivated by terror management theory has consistently found that reminders of one’s own mortality increase worldview defense (e.g., 
        Greenberg et al., 1992, 
        1994, 
        1995, 
        1997; 
        McGregor et al., 1998; 
        Rosenblatt et al., 1989). This research, however, investigated the reverse causal direction from the current studies, namely from death anxiety to group-based attitudes rather than from group-based attitudes to death anxiety. Moreover, research on mortality salience effects has investigated the defense of 
        <em>specific</em> group views rather than a 
        <em>general</em> orientation toward interdependence.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Research on identity fusion has found a correlation between self-reported fusion with a specific group and the willingness to die on its behalf (
        Swann, Gómez, Dovidio, et al., 2010; 
        Swann, Gómez, Huici, et al., 2010). Again, this research has been focused on fusion with specific groups rather than general interdependent self-construal. In addition, the correlational nature of the identity fusion research makes it impossible to know the causal pathway that links identity fusion and self-sacrifice. Therefore, the present research offers novel hypotheses, consistently supported across five experiments, that go beyond previous research and theorizing.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The reduction in the fear of death and increase in one’s readiness to engage in acts of self-sacrifice apparently prompted by the primed sense of interdependence highlights an intriguing consequence of enhanced social identification, namely, the willingness to confront one’s end and sacrifice one’s individual existence on the altar of collectivity. In cases of severe intergroup conflict such sacrifice might be coupled with acts of unbridled violence against the perceived enemy of one’s tribe. Thus, human sociality that lends meaning to our existence (
        Hogg, 2000; 
        Kruglanski et al., 2006, 
        2013; 
        Pyszczynski et al., 2006), and can produce satisfaction and happiness (
        Baumeister &amp; Leary, 1995; 
        Seligman, 2002), also has a dangerous side that may prompt violence and destruction.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The desire for individual immortality implicit in our foregoing analysis is compatible with the heroic depiction that is often bestowed upon acts of martyrdom on behalf of one’s social group. Interdependence priming may also highlight for the individual the group’s evolutionary advantage for her or his close genetic relatives (
        Wilson &amp; Wilson, 2007). This notion has been applied to the study of suicide terrorism (
        Victoroff, 2009). According to an evolutionary account, suicidal terrorism may be one example of 
        <em>altruistic suicide</em> (
        Durkheim, 1897/1997; 
        Pedahzur, Perliger, &amp; Weinberg, 2003). Indeed, early research testing such claims suggests that Palestinian suicide bombers did indeed bestow evolutionary benefits on their kin (
        Blackwell &amp; Sugiyama, 2007). An alternative account to the evolutionary and altruistic motives is that the person may ultimately be pursuing individual level goals such as fame or reward in a presumed afterlife. Future research could profitably explore the potential evolutionary benefits in cases of self-sacrifice as well as the extent to which personal versus group motives are driving the present effects.
      </p><a id="psp-107-2-265-EAADA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Limitations and Directions for Future Research</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">One limitation with the measures of self-sacrifice in these experiments is that, thankfully, our participants did not kill themselves. Whether our participants who stated that they would engage in self-sacrifice would actually commit suicide in the given situations is an open question. It may be the case that participants in the interdependent (vs. independent) condition felt greater pressure to respond according to group goals, while behaving no differently than participants in the independent condition on self-sacrificial behavior. While giving participants the opportunity to commit suicide is not a viable option, we were able to measure participants’ implicit behavioral tendencies using a task for which the purpose was unknown to our participants (Experiment 5). In this way, participants could not respond according to demand characteristics or explicit perception of social pressure. We found converging results using this implicit measure, and while it is still quite removed from actual self-sacrificial behavior, it lends support for the notion that such self-report indices are tapping a pattern that would likely emerge if true behavior were measured.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">While the experiments reported here manipulated independent versus interdependent self-construals, if our hypotheses are correct, then people from cultures where an interdependent self-construal is more prevalent (e.g., Eastern cultures such as Japan) than an independent self-construal (e.g., Western cultures such as the U.S.) should be less afraid of death and be more likely to endorse martyrdom and acts of self-sacrifice. History is ripe with examples of martyrdom and altruistic suicide carried out by individuals from Eastern cultures, including Seppuku (Harakiri) among Samurai since the 12th century, Jauhar in India since the 14th century, Puputan in Bali in the 20th century, Kamikaze pilots from Japan during the second world war, and most recently suicide bombing missions by Islamist terrorists. It seems that such examples are less common within cultures that value independence, and arise in those cultures only when interdependence is highlighted. Although our findings and historical anecdotes point to a possible difference between cultures in death anxiety and willingness to become a martyr, this topic has not been systematically studied.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Cross-cultural examinations of the fear of death are particularly important in light of the fact that mortality salience effects have been observed in collectivist cultures, including China (
          Tam, Chiu, &amp; Lau, 2007), Japan (
          Heine, Harihara, &amp; Niiya, 2002; 
          Wakimoto, 2006), and Iran (
          Pyszczynski et al., 2006). While this may seem to suggest that interdependent self-construals do not reduce death anxiety enough to reduce mortality salience effects, other research has found that Japanese participants were more strongly influenced by thinking about group death than individual death, whereas Australians were more strongly influenced by thinking about individual death than group death (
          Kashima, Halloran, Yuki, &amp; Kashima, 2004); a finding that is consistent with the present analysis. Future research is necessary in order to more fully understand the role of culture in death anxiety.
