The current research proposes and finds an approach aversion effect—individuals feel less positively (or more negatively) about a stimulus if they perceive it to be approaching rather than receding or static. The effect appears general, occurring whether the stimulus is initially negative or nonnegative and whether it moves in space (toward or away from “here”), in time (toward or away from “now”), or in probability (toward or away from “sure”). This research complements extensive existing research on perceived static distance of stimuli (near vs. far) by exploring perceived dynamic movement of stimuli (approaching vs. receding), showing that the effect of movement is distinct from the effect of distance.

Will we hedonically feel differently toward a stimulus if we perceive it to be approaching (moving toward us), receding (moving away from us), or stationary?</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">This question is important both theoretically and practically. Theoretically, knowledge about the effect of perceived dynamic movement complements existing research on the effect of perceived static distance. Many researchers have studied people’s mental construal of statically far versus near stimuli and found that people represent distal (far) stimuli more abstractly than they represent proximal (near) stimuli (e.g., 
        Fujita, Henderson, Eng, Trope, &amp; Liberman, 2006; 
        Henderson, Fujita, Trope, &amp; Liberman, 2006; 
        Liberman &amp; Trope, 1998, 
        2008; 
        Rim, Uleman, &amp; Trope, 2009; 
        Trope &amp; Liberman, 2003, 
        2010). Researchers have also studied the effect of perceived distance on emotional responses and found that the perceived distance of an event can influence the perceived funniness of the event (
        McGraw, Warren, Williams, &amp; Leonard, 2012) and that priming participants with distance can influence their emotional responses to unrelated events (
        Williams &amp; Bargh, 2008). In contrast and as a complement to the extensive literature on the effect of perceived static distance of stimuli (far or near), the current research studies the effect of perceived dynamic movement of stimuli (approaching, receding, or static).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Practically, an understanding of how individuals feel about moving versus static stimuli can address a variety of real-life-relevant questions. For example, suppose that a speaker wants to cast a favorable impression on his audience during a public speech. Should the speaker first stand far from the audience and then gradually move forward, first stand close to the audience and then gradually move backward, or remain constant at the same spot? As another example, suppose that a marketer wants to promote her product in a television commercial. Should she film the product so that it appears approaching the viewer, receding from the viewer, or stationary in front of the viewer?</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Despite the importance of understanding how people feel about moving stimuli, this topic has largely been ignored, with only a few exceptions that we review later. The primary purpose of the present research is to study this topic.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The movement referred to above is movement in space. In life, we encounter not only spatially moving objects but also temporally and probabilistically moving events. By temporal movement, we mean that the occurrence time of a future event approaches (i.e., moves closer to the present moment), recedes (i.e., moves further away from the present moment), or remains unchanged. (By default, events are temporally approaching as time elapses; in the current research, we define the temporal movement of an event relative to this default movement of time.) By probabilistic movement, we mean that the occurrence likelihood of a possible event either approaches (i.e., increases), recedes (i.e., decreases), or is static (i.e., remains unchanged). Thus, in addition to the primary purpose of studying feelings toward spatially moving objects, a second purpose of the current research is to examine feelings toward temporally and probabilistically moving events, that is, to examine whether individuals hedonically feel differently toward an event if they perceive it to be approaching, receding, or static in time or in probability.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The central tenet of this research is that individuals will feel more negatively (or less positively) toward a stimulus if they perceive it to be approaching than if they perceive it to be receding or static and that this is a general and basic human tendency that arises for both stimuli that are a priori negative and stimuli that are a priori nonnegative and for both stimuli that move in space and stimuli that move in time or in probability. We refer to this tendency as 
        <em>approach aversion</em>.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">By proposing approach aversion as a general tendency, we are taking a provocative approach. We intend the present research to be seminal rather than conclusive and to open a dialogue on an understudied topic rather than to put a closure on a well-researched topic. We wish to acknowledge at the beginning of this article that the current research raises many questions that it is unable to answer and will have to await future research to address.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The rest of the article proceeds as follows. First, we discuss the primary approach aversion effect—approach aversion in space. Then, we discuss the extension of approach aversion to the time and probability dimensions. Next, we present a series of eight studies covering diverse stimuli to test for the approach aversion effect. Finally, we discuss implications and open questions from the current research and suggest directions for future research.</p><a id="psp-106-5-699-ELDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_13" title="Approach Aversion in Space">Approach Aversion in Space</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We suggest that approach aversion with spatially moving stimuli is an evolutionarily rooted tendency. In their long struggle for survival, humans have learned that a stimulus will likely pose a greater danger if it is approaching than if it is receding or motionless. For example, an animal will likely pose a greater danger if it is approaching than if not. Therefore, individuals will feel more alarmed (more fearful, more worried, etc.) and hence more negatively about the animal if it is approaching than if not.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">This proposition is relatively easy to understand if the stimulus is a priori negative, especially if it is a priori threatening, such as a hostile-looking wolf. Indeed, 
        Mühlberger, Neumann, Wieser, and Pauli (2008) found an approach aversion effect for negative stimuli. The authors found that participants faced with negatively valenced pictures on a computer screen were more aroused and felt more negative when the pictures appeared approaching than when the pictures appeared receding. 
        Davis, Gross, and Ochsner (2011) replicated this effect for negative stimuli even when the movement of the stimuli was imagined.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">However, we propose that the approach aversion effect will occur even if the stimulus is a priori nonnegative, such as a neutral-looking or amicable-looking deer. Why do we expect an approach aversion effect even for nonnegative stimuli? There are two possible reasons. One is overgeneralization. Research suggests that evolutionarily rooted tendencies are not highly sensitive to specific situations, and people do not always distinguish between situations in which such tendencies are functional and situations in which they are not and tend to carry the tendencies from the former situations to the latter (e.g., 
        Arkes &amp; Ayton, 1999; 
        Hsee, Zhang, Cai, &amp; Zhang, 2013; 
        Klayman &amp; Brown, 1993). In terms of approach aversion, it may well be a functional tendency for stimuli that are negative and would actually pose a greater danger when approaching, but people may continue to exhibit the tendency for stimuli that are nonnegative and would not pose a greater danger when approaching.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Second, a stimulus that is overall nonnegative may be ambivalent—containing both positive elements and negative (even potentially threatening) elements (
        Priester &amp; Petty, 1996; 
        Rees, Rothman, Lehavy, &amp; Sanchez-Burks, 2013; 
        Rodriguez Mosquera, Parrott, &amp; Hurtado de Mendoza, 2010), and these negative elements may carry more weight in the hedonic response of the viewer when the stimulus is approaching than when not. For example, a deer that looks neutral or amicable may still entail the potential of causing harm, and this negative element may carry more weight when the deer is approaching than when not. In other words, even a neutral- or amicable-looking deer may pose a greater danger—real or imaged—when it is approaching than when not. Therefore, individuals will exhibit the approaching aversion effect even toward such nonnegative stimuli.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Several clarifications are in order here. First, the two reasons discussed above may coexist to generate approach aversion. It is beyond the scope of this research to empirically tease apart these reasons, and we speculate on the relative viability of these two reasons in the General Discussion. Second, approach aversion is about relative feelings between the approaching condition and the receding and static conditions, and so, we use the phrases 
        <em>more negatively</em> and 
        <em>less positively</em> interchangeably. In terms of a nonnegative stimulus, approach aversion does not mean that individuals will feel negatively in the absolute sense when the stimulus approaches; instead, it means that they will feel relatively less positively when the stimulus approaches than when not. Finally, whereas we consider approach aversion general and applicable to nonnegative stimuli, we are agnostic about whether or not the effect is equally strong across different valence conditions. The focus of this research is to demonstrate the existence of the approach aversion effect for nonnegative stimuli, especially for neutral stimuli, and not to compare the approach aversion effect between different valence conditions. Accordingly, we examine only neutral stimuli in most of our studies and include positive and negative stimuli in only some studies.

Objectively, space, time, and probability are separate and independent dimensions, but as evidenced in ample research, they are interconnected psychologically (
        Trope &amp; Liberman, 2010). For example, people tend to group concepts suggesting spatial, temporal, and probabilistic nearness (e.g., near, tomorrow, sure) together and group concepts suggesting spatial, temporal, and probabilistic farness (e.g., far, year, maybe) together (
        Bar-Anan, Liberman, Trope, &amp; Algom, 2007); people associate words suggesting spatial, temporal, and probabilistic nearness with concreteness and associate words suggesting spatial, temporal, and probabilistic farness with abstractness (
        Bar-Anan, Liberman, &amp; Trope, 2006); people associate nearness in one of these dimensions with nearness in another and associate farness in one of these dimensions with farness in another (e.g., 
        Caruso, Van Boven, Chin, &amp; Ward, 2013; 
        Wakslak &amp; Trope, 2008); people respond similarly to size, time, and probability in both the joint and the single evaluation modes (e.g., 
        Hsee &amp; Zhang 2010; 
        Hsee, Zhang, Wang, &amp; Zhang, 2013).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Given the interconnectedness of these dimensions, we predict that the approach aversion effect in the domain of space will manifest itself in the domain of time and probability as well. Specifically, we propose that individuals will feel more negatively (or less positively) toward an event if they perceive the event to be approaching in time (closer to now) or in probability (closer to certainty) than if they perceive it to be receding or static in time or in probability, even if the event is a priori nonnegative.</p><a id="psp-106-5-699-EJDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_24" title="Overview of Studies">Overview of Studies</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We now report eight studies to test for the approach aversion effect. Of these studies, the first six examined the primary approach aversion effect—approach aversion in space—and the last two studies tested its extension to time (Study 7) and to probability (Study 8). All the studies used nonnegative (neutral stimuli) stimuli, and three of the studies (Study 2, Study 3, and Study 7) also manipulated the valence of the stimuli. To test the generality of the approach aversion effect, the studies adopted a diverse set of stimuli, ranging from visually displayed symbols (Study 1 and Study 2), videotaped persons (Study 3 and Study 4), audiotaped sounds (Study 5), physically presented objects (Study 6), and verbally described events (Study 7 and Study 8). To explore the underlying mechanism, two of the studies (Study 3 and Study 5) also included mediation evidence. To further explore the mechanism and the process, one of the studies (Study 4) also manipulated the agent of movement (stimulus vs. the viewer), and another (Study 6) traced participants’ hedonic feelings while the stimulus was moving.</p><a id="psp-106-5-699-EIDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_27" title="Study 1: Letters">Study 1: Letters</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Study 1 was exploratory, seeking to demonstrate the approach aversion effect in an innocuous context with neutral English alphabets. In a within-participants design, the study manipulated the size of the letters to mimic movement and elicited participants’ hedonic responses toward the letters.</p><a id="psp-106-5-699-EBIDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The stimuli were neutral English letters displayed in short video clips, each lasting approximately 20 s. To create the stimuli, we adopted the following selection process. First, we selected six diverse fonts of the capitalized English alphabet from a fonts website and excluded redundant letters (letters that looked similar in different fonts), thus retaining 139 letters. Then we recruited a group of pretest participants (
          <em>N</em> = 200), presented each participant with a subset of the 139 letters, and asked them to rate their feelings toward each letter on a 7-point scale ranging from 
          <em>very negative</em> to 
          <em>very positive.</em> We used all the letters that were rated neutral as our final stimuli, that is, letters with pretest positivity ratings between ±0.5 from the midpoint of the scale; there were 32 such letters.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">For each of the 32 letters, we created three movement versions of videos: approaching, receding, and static. Following existing research showing that movement in space can be simulated by change in size (
          McGraw et al., 2012; 
          Mühlberger et al., 2008), we manipulated the movement of the letter by varying its size on the screen. In the approaching version, the letter was initially small, occupying approximately 10% of the screen area, and during the video, it gradually increased in size until it was large, occupying approximately 90% of the screen area; in the receding version, the size of the letter changed in the reverse direction to that in the approaching condition; in the static version, the size of the letter stayed unchanged, always between the smallest and the largest size in the other two conditions.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Participants were 174 adults (47 females; mean age = 26 years) recruited via the Amazon Mechanical Turk. They were told that they would view video clips of English letters, that the letter in each clip may or may not move, and that their task was to rate their feelings toward the letter. Each participant was randomly assigned to view 16 of the 32 letters, and for each letter, each participant was randomly assigned to view one of the approaching, the receding, and the static versions of videos. At the end of each video, participants rated their feelings about the letter on a 7-point scale ranging from 
          <em>very negative</em> to 
          <em>very positive.</em></p><a id="psp-106-5-699-EAIDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Results and Discussion</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Table 1 summarizes the results. A multivariate regression analysis with positivity ratings as the dependent variable and movement, letter, and participant (all coded as dummy variables) as independent variables yielded a significant movement effect,

          Table 1 for details). (We have also reported the comparison between the receding and the static letters in the table but do not discuss it here as it was theoretically unimportant to the current research.)

The movement of the icon took approximately 3 s; each video clip lasted approximately 20 s and replayed this movement six times, giving the perception that a series of emoticons were approaching the viewer one after another. (We replayed the movement multiple times in this study because the duration of the movement was rather short and we were worried participants might not pay enough attention if the movement was played only once. In subsequent studies, we prolonged the duration of the movement of the stimulus and did not replay the movement.) The receding version of the video was identical to the approaching condition, except that the direction of the movement was reversed, thus giving the perception that the emoticon was moving away from the viewer. In the static version, the emoticon remained motionless, with its size being in the middle between the largest and the smallest sizes in the other two conditions.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Participants in the study were 320 adults (128 females; mean age = 29 years) recruited via the Amazon Mechanical Turk.

Second, whereas Study 1 and Study 2 included only one static condition, Study 3 included two static conditions—static-near, in which the stimulus was always near the camera, and static-far, in which the stimulus was always far away. Including both static-near and static-far conditions was important because these conditions would enable us to tease apart the effect of movement (approaching vs. receding) from the effect of distance (far vs. near). Finally, Study 3 elicited not only participants’ positivity ratings (overall feelings) but also their fear ratings and allowed us to probe for the mechanism underlying approach aversion.</p><a id="psp-106-5-699-EBGDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The stimulus in the study was a male person in a video clip.

In the approaching version, the image of the person was originally small, occupying about 20% of the screen area, but gradually increased during the video display until it occupied about 90% of the screen area, giving the perception that the person was gradually walking forward toward the viewer. In the receding version, the movement was the reverse of that in the approaching version, giving the perception that the person was gradually walking backward away from the viewer. In the static-near version, the image was always as large as the largest size in the approaching and receding conditions, giving the perception that the person was always close to the viewer. In the static-far version, the image was always as small as the smallest size in the approaching and receding conditions, giving the perception that the person was always remote. In all versions, the person slightly moved his lips as if he were talking and also slightly moved his body left and right to seem like he was walking naturally and realistically. To verify that our movement manipulation was effective, we recruited another group of pretest participants (
          <em>N</em> = 56), showed them an excerpt of one of the four movement versions of the videos (all in the neutral condition), and asked them which of the following statements best described their perception of the video: (a) The target person walked closer toward them, (b) the target person walked farther away from them, (c) they walked closer toward the target person, (d) they walked farther away from the target person, or (e) the distance between them and the target person did not change much. Most of the respondents perceived the video as we expected. Specifically, 100% of the respondents viewing the approaching version perceived the target person as walking closer toward them, 92% of the respondents viewing the receding version perceived the target person as walking farther away from them, 93% of the respondents viewing the static-far version and 86% of the respondents viewing the static-near versions perceived the distance as unchanged, all χ

As we proposed earlier, approach aversion arises because the stimulus appears more threatening in the approaching condition than in the other conditions. Thus, we predicted that the fear ratings would mediate the effect of approaching on the positivity ratings. A mediation analysis supported this prediction. Specifically, approaching (vs. other conditions) lowered positivity ratings (β = −1.10, 
            <em>p</em> &lt; .01) and also increased fear ratings (β = .79, 
            <em>p</em> &lt; .01); fear ratings, in turn, lowered positivity ratings (β = −.88,

            MacKinnon, Fairchild, &amp; Fritz 2007;

The study also collected fear responses and, consistent with our theory, found that fear mediated the effect of approaching on positivity judgment.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Note that Study 3 included two static conditions, static-far and static-near, and two dynamic conditions, approaching and receding. These conditions enabled us to distinguish the approach aversion effect from two other possible effects—mere distance and mere movement. By mere-distance effect, we mean that people may feel more negatively or more positively about a stimulus if it is near rather than far. For example, people may feel less comfortable if another person is near rather than far (e.g., 
            Argyle &amp; Dean, 1965; 
            Mobbs et al., 2007). The approach aversion effect was different from such a mere-distance effect because, in our study, participants in the approaching condition felt more negatively not only than those in the static-far condition but also than those in the static-near condition. By a mere-movement effect, we mean that individuals may feel more negatively or more positively about a stimulus if it is moving than if it is static, regardless of whether it is approaching or receding. The approach aversion effect was also different because, in our study, participants in the approaching condition felt more negatively not only than those in the static conditions but also than those in the receding condition. Thus, approach aversion is neither due to the absolute distance of the stimulus nor due to any kind of movement of the stimulus but rather due to the approaching movement of the stimulus.

Will the approach aversion effect also arise in situations in which respondents perceive themselves as approaching the stimulus? We doubt so. If respondents are approaching the stimulus, it usually implies that the stimulus is benign and harmless (
        Bem, 1972; 
        Higgins, 1997). Even if respondents are not actively approaching the stimulus themselves and are only led to perceive themselves as approaching the stimulus, they may still take this perception as implying that the stimulus is benign (
        Labroo &amp; Nielsen, 2010). Thus, we predicted that the approach aversion effect will be weaker or disappear if respondents perceive themselves as approaching the stimulus rather than perceive the stimulus as approaching them. To test this prediction, we conducted Study 4, in which we manipulated not only movement but also the perceived agent of movement. We focused on neutral stimuli only.

          Table 4 for details). These results highlighted the moderating role of perceived agent of movement—perceiving the stimulus as moving is an important condition for the approach aversion effect to occur.

It appeared that what mattered was the perception, not the reality. In theory, movement is always relative, such that a changing distance between a person and a stimulus can be perceived either as the stimulus moving or the person moving. In reality, it is not always clear whether the agent of movement is the stimulus, the person, or both. Because people are egocentric, we suspect that in such ambiguous situations, people tend to perceive the stimulus as moving rather than them as moving. For example, people intuitively perceive the sun as circulating around them rather than them circulating around the sun. Likewise, in Study 3 in which we did not tell participants whether the target person was moving or they were moving, most respondents perceived the target person as moving, as we demonstrated in the pretest.

        </em></span></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The current research yields both theoretical and practical implications. Theoretically, it contributes to at least three existing lines of work. One is research on human reactions to near versus far stimuli, notably construal level theory (
        Liberman &amp; Trope, 1998, 
        2008). Like construal level theory, our research studies people’s reactions toward stimuli with varying distances and demonstrates that people behave similarly in the spatial, temporal, and probabilistic dimensions. But our research differs from construal level theory in several ways. The key dependent variable in construal level theory is mental construal—abstract or concrete—whereas the key dependent variable in our research is hedonic reactions—positive or negative. The key independent variable in construal level theory is static distance—far or near—whereas the key independent variable in our research is dynamic movement—approaching, receding, or static. The key finding from construal level theory is that people adopt a more concrete mental construal for statically near stimuli than for statically far stimuli, whereas the key finding from our research is that people react more negatively toward dynamically approaching stimuli than toward dynamically receding or static stimuli.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The current research also complements existing research on approach–avoidance conflict (
        Epstein &amp; Fenz, 1962) and on goal gradient (
        Anderson, 1933; 
        Hull, 1932, 
        1938). According to the approach–avoidance conflict research, the relative weights of negative stimuli over positive stimuli are greater when the stimuli are near rather than far, and therefore, when faced with mixed positive and negative stimuli, individuals will be more likely to avoid those stimuli if the stimuli are near rather than far (e.g., 
        Miller, 1944). According to the goal gradient research, an attractive goal will be more attractive if it is near than if it is far, and therefore, individuals will be more motivated to approach the goal if it is near rather than far (e.g., 
        Kivetz, Urminsky, &amp; Zheng, 2006). Although our research is also concerned with approach versus nonapproach, it is different from these existing lines of research. In the existing research, the independent variable is generally distance (near or far), whereas in ours, it is movement (approach or not). In the existing research, approach versus nonapproach is generally a dependent variable, whereas in our research, it is an independent variable and the dependent variable is hedonic reactions. In other words, the existing research studies approach/avoidance behaviors toward far versus near stimuli, whereas our research studies hedonic reactions toward approaching versus nonapproaching stimuli.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Finally, the current research also enriches the seminal research by 
        Mühlberger et al. (2008) showing that people respond more negatively toward approaching negative stimuli than toward receding negative stimuli. The current research has demonstrated the approaching aversion effect with both negative and nonnegative stimuli, with both visual and audio stimuli, and with both spatially moving objects and temporally and probabilistically moving events. Why did the current research find an approach aversion effect for nonnegative stimuli whereas the previous research did not? A possible reason is that the procedure used in the previous research was too subtle. For example, Mühlberger et al. simulated movement by varying the size of pictures in a between-participants design, so the sense of movement may have been weak; moreover, they measured hedonic reactions after measuring other (startle) responses. To make the sense of movement salient, we either adopted a within-participants design (Study 1), replayed the movement multiple times (Study 2), or used stimuli with real or highly realistic movement (Studies 3–6); moreover, we measured hedonic reactions right after the movement manipulation.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Besides its contributions to the exiting psychological literature, the current research also yields practical implications. Although approach aversion is likely a general tendency, people do not always realize it or take it into consideration when interacting with others. During a conversation at a party, a person who intends to befriend another person may gradually approach the other person without realizing that doing so may achieve the opposite. During a lecture, the speaker may gradually walk closer to the audience without realizing that doing so may cast an unfavorable impression on the audience. In a television commercial, the marketer may gradually move the product closer to the viewer without realizing that doing so may hurt the image of the product. When deciding whether or when to hold a meeting, the organizer may first announce the likelihood of the meeting to be low and then gradually increase the likelihood or may first schedule the meeting far in the future and then gradually move it sooner without realizing that doing so may make the potential attendees dread the meeting. Our research highlights the importance of such considerations.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The current research is still preliminary and leaves many questions unanswered. In the rest of this section, we explore some of these open questions and offer our speculative answers.</p><a id="psp-106-5-699-EFADA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Feelings Toward the Stimulus Versus Overall Feelings</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Our research suggests that approach aversion may arise even for positive stimuli. Does it mean that people will feel less happy overall when something they like approaches them? For example, would a fisherman feel less happy if the fish he or she wishes to catch swims closer? We speculate that the answer is no. We distinguish between two types of feelings—feelings toward the stimulus and overall feelings. If the fish one hopes to catch swims closer, it is possible that the person feels happier overall but at the same time feels more negatively (more fearful, more worried, etc.) about the fish (the stimulus) per se. Our research is about feelings toward the stimulus, not overall feelings.</p><a id="psp-106-5-699-EEADA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Ambivalence Versus Overgeneralization</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In the introduction, we offered two reasons why approach aversion may arise for nonnegative stimuli. One is overgeneralization—that approach aversion is functional in some situations (e.g., when the stimulus is indeed harmful) but not in others (e.g., when the stimulus is innocuous), yet individuals do not distinguish between the two types of situations and exhibit the effect in both types of situations. The other explanation concerns the notion of ambivalence—that an overall nonnegative stimulus may still contain negative elements and those elements may carry more weight when the stimulus is approaching than when not. Which of these two reasons is more viable? In two of our studies (Study 1 and Study 2), the stimuli (English alphabets and face icons) seemed rather innocuous and unambiguous, yet we still observed approach aversion. These results suggest that overgeneralization is sufficient for approach aversion. Nevertheless, even in those studies, we were not able to entirely rule out the possibility that participants may have perceived such simple symbols and icons as containing negative elements. Therefore, to tease apart the overgeneralization and ambivalence explanations, future researchers will need to empirically manipulate the degree of ambivalence of the stimuli while keeping the overall valence of the stimuli constant.</p><a id="psp-106-5-699-EDADA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Intentionality of the Stimulus</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Does the approach aversion effect arise because respondents infer a malignant intention of the stimulus from its approaching movement? For example, in Study 3 (on person perception), did the approach aversion effect arise because the respondents interpreted the approaching movement of the target person as an indicator of malignant intentions such as attacking the perceiver? Our answer to this question is twofold: On one hand, we believe that in many cases, if an animal or a person approaches another person, it is indeed possible that the former intends to hurt the latter. This is consistent with our conjecture that the approach aversion tendency is evolutionarily functional. Thus, we speculate that the approach aversion effect will be more pronounced if the stimulus is an animal or a person who is capable of having a malignant intention. On the other hand, we do not believe that the capability of having a malignant intention is a necessary condition for the approach aversion effect to occur. As mentioned earlier, approach aversion is an overlearned tendency. People do not always make a rational decision of whether to exhibit this tendency when encountering an approaching stimulus, and they may exhibit the tendency even when the stimulus has no malignant intentions. For example in Study 1, the stimuli were English letters, and in Study 5, the stimuli were posters. These stimuli were unlikely to entail malignant intentions. In Study 7 and Study 8, the timing and probability of the cousin’s visit were said to depend solely on the availability of airline tickets and hence did not reflect the intention of the cousin. Yet we still observed an approach aversion effect in all of these studies. Thus, we surmise that perceived malignant intent is not a necessary condition for approach aversion but may be a moderator that can strengthen or attenuate the effect.</p><a id="psp-106-5-699-ECADA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Powerlessness Versus Action Preparedness</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Does the approach aversion effect occur because people feel powerless when encountering an approaching stimulus and hence feel negatively? Again, we suggest a two-sided answer. On one hand, we speculate that people will feel less in control and hence less powerful when a stimulus is approaching them than when it is not. This speculation is consistent with the result of Study 4, showing that the approach aversion effect would vanish if the participants perceived themselves as approaching the stimulus; presumably, participants in that condition felt more in control and more powerful. On the other hand, we doubt that people will feel completely out of control or powerless when a stimulus is approaching them; instead, they will feel a sense of alarm and a need to prepare themselves for action (e.g., to fight or flee). The notion of action preparedness is consistent with the results of Study 3 and Study 5 showing that approaching stimuli were associated with fear. Fear is an arousal feeling (
          Russell, 1980) and reflects a need for action. This notion is also consistent with the finding from 
          Mühlberger et al. (2008) showing that approaching stimuli led to heightened startle responses and arousals. We hope that future research will better examine the role of power and action preparedness in hedonic reactions toward moving stimuli.

Will there be a parallel effect for receding stimuli—a more positive feeling toward receding stimuli than toward nonreceding stimuli? Empirically, our studies did not find such an effect. Theoretically, the effect is possible (which our studies may not be powerful enough to detect). However, if it exists, the effect is likely due to other reasons than the reasons for approach aversion. One possible reason why people may feel more positively toward a receding stimulus is that a receding stimulus induces a sense of loss and people are loss averse and attach more value to a loss than to a gain; another possible reason is that a receding stimulus creates a sense of scarcity and people consider what is scarce to be more valuable. These speculations will need future research to test.</p><a id="psp-106-5-699-EAADA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Conclusion</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Stimuli are constantly moving around us—objects are approaching or receding in space, and events are approaching or receding in time and in likelihood.
