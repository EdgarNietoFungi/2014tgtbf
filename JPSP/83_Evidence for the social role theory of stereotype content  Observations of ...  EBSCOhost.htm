In a novel test of how stereotypes can develop from observations, preliminary research collected participants’ beliefs about the occupational roles (e.g., lawyer, teacher, fast food worker, chief executive officer, store clerk, manager) in which members of social groups (e.g., Black women, Hispanics, White men, the rich, senior citizens, high school dropouts) are overrepresented relative to their numbers in the general population. These beliefs about groups’ typical occupational roles proved to be generally accurate when evaluated in relation to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Then, correlational studies predicted participants’ stereotypes of social groups from the attributes ascribed to group members’ typical occupational roles (Studies 1a, 1b, and 1c), the behaviors associated with those roles (Study 2), and the occupational interest profile of the roles (Study 3). As predicted by social role theory, beliefs about the attributes of groups’ typical roles were strongly related to group stereotypes on both communion and agency/competence. In addition, an experimental study (Study 4) demonstrated that when social groups were described with changes to their typical social roles in the future, their projected stereotypes were more influenced by these future roles than by their current group stereotypes, thus supporting social role theory’s predictions about stereotype change. Discussion considers the implications of these findings for stereotype change and the relation of social role theory to other theories of stereotype content.

Such stereotypes provide quick and easy assumptions that affect behavior toward members of social groups (
        Schneider, 2004; 
        Yzerbyt &amp; Demoulin, 2010). Although common sense indicates that the stereotypes of men and women could not be easily exchanged, such insights do not explain the sources of these stereotypes’ content. What information leads social perceivers to ascribe particular attributes to social groups? This article explores a social role theory explanation of the content of stereotypes.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Our research breaks new ground even though social role theory is well known. The theory’s visibility in relation to stereotyping is almost exclusively as an explanation of gender stereotypes, consistent with its early presentation in a gender context (
        Eagly &amp; Steffen, 1984). For example, 
        Fiske, Cuddy, Glick, and Xu (2002, p. 882) characterized it as the “social role theory of gender stereotypes.” Moreover, the theory’s validity even for gender stereotypes has been questioned. In particular, one critique is that substantial changes have occurred in women’s roles without changes in gender stereotypes, presumably refuting the theory (
        Rudman, Moss-Racusin, Glick, &amp; Phelan, 2012, p. 177). Given these considerations, the main purposes of this article are twofold: (a) to establish the validity of social role theory as a general theory of the stereotypes of social groups, and (b) to advance thinking about stereotype change, including correcting the misunderstanding that social role theory predicts that all changes in groups’ roles would change their stereotypes.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Social role theory postulates that social perceivers’ beliefs about social groups in their society derive from their experiences with group members in their typical social roles—that is, in roles in which these group members are overrepresented relative to their numbers in the general population (
        Eagly, 1987; 
        Eagly &amp; Wood, 2012; 
        Wood &amp; Eagly, 2012). The behaviors enacted within these roles influence the traits that perceivers assume are characteristic of the group, a process enabled by correspondent inference (
        Gawronski, 2003; 
        Gilbert, 1998). For example, when women, more often than men, are observed in paid and unpaid roles that involve caring for children, perceivers assume that women possess communal traits, such as social sensitivity, warmth, and nurturance, which are thought to enable the behaviors required by these roles. In essence, social perceivers observe that members of a group occupy certain social roles relatively more than members of other groups do. Perceivers’ correspondent inferences from group members’ behaviors in their typical roles generalize to the entire group, and group stereotypes are born.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">These social role predictions distinguish between social groups and their specific roles. This distinction follows from the breadth of the settings within which roles and groups are influential. A 
        <em>role</em> is a set of expectations associated with a particular social position in a specific type of setting (
        Biddle, 1979; 
        Staines, 1986). A school teacher, for example, has extensive obligations within a school setting but minimal obligations as a teacher when visiting another city. In contrast, membership in a social 
        <em>group</em> based on demographic variables such as age, race, or gender has trans-situational influence. A man, for example, has obligations based on being male in all settings in which his gender is identified. This distinction between roles and groups resembles the distinction in expectation states theory between 
        <em>specific status characteristics</em>, which operate in a circumscribed range of settings, and 
        <em>diffuse status characteristics</em>, which operate trans-situationally (
        Correll &amp; Ridgeway, 2003; 
        Ridgeway, 2011).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">When forming stereotypes, social perceivers weight most heavily those behaviors that they perceive as typical of a group (see also 
        Tajfel, 1981). Because most behaviors are organized into social roles in daily life, social role theory emphasizes typicality of groups’ roles, which is defined by group members being observed to occupy them in disproportional numbers, compared with the group’s representation in society as a whole. From this perspective, occupational roles, broadly conceived to include paid and unpaid work, are particularly influential. Whereas other types of roles (e.g., familial, friendship) have similar occupancies across most social groups, occupational roles seldom represent groups equally (see 
        U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2013a). For example, Hispanics are common in lawn service roles, senior citizens in store clerk and volunteer roles, and high school dropouts in food service and fast food roles. In addition, occupational roles are described by extensive government data on role characteristics and role occupancies (e.g., from U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics), which facilitated our testing of social role theory. Therefore, we have chosen to test social role theory in relation to the specific domain of occupational roles although social role predictions should also be valid in relation to other roles disproportionally occupied by members of social groups.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Although there are several theories of stereotype content (e.g., 
        Alexander, Brewer, &amp; Herrmann, 1999; 
        Fiske et al., 2002), we favor social role theory as providing the most plausible account of the psychological processes underlying stereotyping because it focuses on the directly observable behaviors of group members. Social perceivers observe these behaviors in the context of social roles because social life is organized by occupational, family, friendship, leisure, and other roles, each of which is associated with certain types of behaviors. In comparison, other theories invoke features of social structure such as status and interdependence as the main sources of stereotypes (
        Alexander et al., 1999; 
        Fiske et al., 2002). Yet, such information is not necessarily discernible from behavior but instead requires that perceivers have acquired considerable knowledge about intergroup relations. Although social structural information is correlated with group stereotypes, it is unlikely to provide the basic observations from which social perceivers construct these stereotypes. The ease with which even young children acquire stereotypes (e.g., 
        Martin &amp; Ruble, 2010) suggests that simpler processes involving categorization by roles and groups and inferences from behaviors to traits can account for stereotyping. As our research seeks to demonstrate, the everyday activities (observed directly or indirectly through media) that are performed by members of social groups to carry out their social roles provide most of the information that social perceivers readily notice and use to create group stereotypes.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Past research on social role theory is limited in scope because it has addressed mainly stereotypes based on gender (
        Diekman &amp; Eagly, 2000; 
        Eagly &amp; Steffen, 1984, 
        1986; see also 
        Yount, 1986), with rare applications to other stereotypes (age, 
        Kite, 1996; income, 
        Johannesen-Schmidt &amp; Eagly, 2002). The current study addressed stereotypes based not only on gender, age, and income, but also on race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, education level, and political parties, all in the same design. Another limitation of past research is inherent in its usual designs, which relied on portraying social groups with and without information about their roles (e.g., 
        Eagly &amp; Steffen, 1984). Because critics have raised questions about whether this role information affects judgment standards and thus compromises these demonstrations (see 
        Bosak, Sczesny, &amp; Eagly, 2012), a more convincing design would compare perceptions of groups and their typical roles. Our research takes this approach and thus provides a direct and strong test of the central claim of social role theory—that group stereotypes for a wide range of groups correspond closely to stereotypes of the specific social roles in which group members are perceived as overrepresented.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">To the extent that stereotypes are derived from observations of group members’ behavior, stereotypes would also have substantial group-level accuracy. In fact, stereotypes have been shown to be moderately to highly accurate in relation to the attributes of many commonly observed social groups within cultures (e.g., 
        Chan et al., 2012; 
        Diekman, Eagly, &amp; Kulesa, 2002; 
        Hall &amp; Carter, 1999; 
        Halpern, Straight, &amp; Stephenson, 2011; 
        Jussim, 2005, 
        2012; 
        Rogers &amp; Wood, 2010; 
        Ryan, 2002; 
        Swim, 1994; but see 
        Terracciano et al., 2005). Evidence of accuracy suggests that stereotypes reflect social reality (
        Jussim, Cain, Crawford, Harber, &amp; Cohen, 2009) even though they produce biased judgments of atypical individuals, who may be assimilated to or contrasted from their group stereotypes (
        Biernat, 2003, 
        2005; 
        von Hippel, Sekaquaptewa, &amp; Vargas, 1995). According to social role theory, the key aspect of the social reality represented in group stereotypes is the typical roles occupied by members of a group. In a strong test of this theory, the current research also tests the proposition that the roles that perceivers believe are associated with particular groups are generally accurate representations of role occupancy, on which stereotypes are then based. Of course, even though stereotypes can be generally accurate when based on observed role distributions, neither these distributions nor the stereotypical traits inferred from them provide evidence of the nature or nurture causes of group differences (cf. 
        Eagly &amp; Wood, 2013).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The first studies that we report in this article related stereotypes of a large number of social groups to the averaged attributes of their typical occupational roles. This design requires that we (a) determine the occupational roles believed to be typical for social groups and assess the accuracy of these beliefs (Preliminary Study), and (b) separately assess stereotypes of groups and attributes of roles and relate the group stereotypes to the average attributes of the roles considered most typical of each group (Studies 1a, 1b, and 1c; Study 2; Study 3). A separate study experimentally manipulated these typical roles to assess how expected changes in group members’ typical roles produce anticipated change in their stereotypes (Study 4). In most of our analyses, collectives in the form of groups and roles form the units of analysis rather than individual participants, consistent with our stance that group stereotypes are consensual, cultural entities. As in much cross-cultural research (e.g., 
        Nosek et al., 2009; 
        Zentner &amp; Mitura, 2012) as well as some research on stereotypes (e.g., 
        Hall &amp; Carter, 1999), data from various sources are aggregated to the collective level and then statistically analyzed.
      </p><a id="psp-107-3-371-EFDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_14" title="Preliminary Study">Preliminary Study</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Our first steps were to determine the occupational roles in which group members are regarded as overrepresented and to show that they are plausibly based on valid observations and not on mere guesses created by groups’ stereotypes. Suggesting accuracy, and consistent with research on stereotype accuracy in general (e.g., 
        Jussim, 2005, 
        2012; 
        Ryan, 2002), past research has shown that estimates of the sex distributions of various occupations correlated highly with their actual sex distributions, 
        <em>r</em>(78) = .93, 
        <em>p</em> &lt; .001 (
        Cejka &amp; Eagly, 1999). Nonetheless, it is important to test the accuracy of perceptions of the typical roles occupied by a wide range of groups. We thus determined groups’ typical social roles by asking participants to list occupational roles for a variety of groups and then examined the accuracy of these typical roles by relating them to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) occupational data.
      </p><a id="psp-107-3-371-EBFDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Selection of Typical Roles</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Two pretest samples consisted of 313 community members (62.5% women; mean age of 36.47 years with a 
            <em>SD</em> of 14.21; 64.8% European American, 14.5% African American, 5.2% Hispanic, 4.7% Asian American, and 10.8% other or unreported) and 257 students from a Midwestern university (53.1% women; mean age of 20.43 years with a 
            <em>SD</em> of 2.59; 64.6% European American, 17.3% Asian American, 6.3% African American, 4.3% Hispanic, and 7.5% other or unreported). The community sample was recruited from public settings (e.g., parks, festivals, food courts) in Chicago and the surrounding area. Surveyors asked every third person or group of people who appeared to be at least 18 years old to complete a short questionnaire. The student sample was recruited from public settings on campus. These two samples were used to procure the typical roles for Study 1a and 1b. In addition, because our main hypotheses were also tested at a West Coast university (in Study 1c), another 58 students (65.5% women; mean age of 19.81 years with a 
            <em>SD</em> of 3.55; 79.3% were European American, 10.3% Hispanic, 3.4% Asian American, and 6.9% other or unreported) from this university completed the same task to check that the groups were similarly associated with roles in this second location.
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Participants were instructed to name three occupations that they had observed as disproportionately and frequently held by members of the given group, including illegitimate occupations such as prostitution, informal occupations such as volunteering, and non-occupations such as unemployment. The task was framed as a study of the accuracy of participants’ knowledge of how occupational roles vary across groups compared to census data. In total, 45 groups were selected to represent a wide variety of distinctions of gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, age, education level, socioeconomic status, and political orientation. We used the categories of Black men, Black women, White men, and White women because stereotypes of intersecting categories often differ from those of gender or race alone (see 
            Ghavami &amp; Peplau, 2013; 
            Niemann, Jennings, Rozelle, Baxter, &amp; Sullivan, 1994). Yet, to keep the number of groups manageable, the other groups were not separated by gender. Each community participant performed the role naming task for 2 groups, and each student participant for 2–15 groups.
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Results</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Two persons coded each of the roles generated by participants into 1 of 114 occupations (e.g., car salesman, librarian, nurse, truck driver) with 91.9% and 91.7% agreement for the two main community and Midwest student samples, respectively. To select the groups and associated roles for the main studies, these codings were totaled to find groups associated with consensual roles. Within each of the two samples, any group was eliminated if it yielded one third or more of missing or uncodeable responses, if the most frequently listed role accumulated less than 10% of responses, or if the three top roles included fewer than 22% of all responses. These rules were slightly relaxed for Black women in the community sample and Black men in the Midwest student sample in order to retain them because they were parallel to the retained groups of White men and White women. Across the groups selected in each sample, the first, second, and third most common occupational roles were mentioned on average by 48.6%, 38.3%, and 29.2% of the participants in the community sample, respectively, and 52.2%, 39.1%, and 31.7% of participants in the Midwest student sample (participants each mentioned 3 roles, so percentages can add to over 100). The West Coast university sample confirmed a similar set of roles as the Midwest sample (the two top roles were the same for 19 of the 22 groups selected for use in the main study, although in 10 of these cases the order of the top and second role was reversed; in the 3 cases in which the roles did not match, we looked at the percentage of people in both samples who nominated each role and selected the most common across both samples), and thus Study 1c included students from both the Midwest and West Coast. From the original 45 groups, 26 of the groups exceeding these criteria were selected for the main study with the community sample (Study 1a) and 22 in each student sample (Studies 1b and 1c).</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Although not all of our original 45 groups were identified as having consensual typical roles (e.g., lesbians, Democrats, feminists, environmentalists, vegetarians, atheists, Muslims, physically handicapped), 84% of them did. This lack of consensual occupational roles for some groups may reflect participant individual differences in opportunities for direct and indirect observation of these groups. For example, some people may have few observations of vegetarians, and others have many. Other groups may be too broadly defined to produce clear stereotypes or beliefs about roles. For example, physically handicapped people may or may not be channeled into certain types of occupational roles, depending on the type and severity of their handicap. We consider in the General Discussion how stereotypes may be formed when role information is not easily observed.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">For the main study, the design included (a) 26 groups and their 3 most commonly noted roles in Study 1a, (b) 22 groups and their 3 most commonly noted roles in Study 1b, and (c) 22 groups and their 2 most commonly noted roles in Study 1c. Some roles (e.g., lawyers) were associated with more than one group (e.g., the rich, conservatives). 
            Table 1 lists the groups and corresponding roles for each study. For example, in Study 1a, the roles most commonly nominated as overrepresenting the group Asians were dry cleaner worker, doctor, and small business owner, and for the group White men were business professional, lawyer, and politician.

Borbely, personal communication, October 28, 2011; 
            U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2005b). In total, 50% of the groups could be identified in the BLS data. The following social groups could be precisely identified: Asians, Black men, Black women, Hispanics, White women, and White men. Also precisely identifiable were the educational groups of high school dropouts, high school graduates, and people with a bachelor’s degree. With some approximations, we also identified (a) the age groups of 20-somethings and middle-aged/baby boomers and (b) the income groups of poor, middle class, and upper middle class, which were guided by the Census Bureau definition of poverty (
            U.S. Department of Commerce, U.S. Census Bureau, n.d.) and the definition of the middle class used by economists (applied to the median personal income in 2004;

The BLS does not classify individuals by religion, sexual orientation, or political ideology, so the typical roles of these groups could not be checked for accuracy.

This ratio was produced for each group by dividing its percentage in each typical role across all the samples by its percentage among all employed persons (according to the BLS data) and then averaging these ratios across each group’s typical occupations. Group representation ratios above 1.00 indicate overrepresentation of the group as averaged across their typical occupations, and ratios below 1.00 indicate underrepresentation, compared to the group’s representation in the overall labor force (see 
            Table 2). For example, Hispanics are 43.8% of grounds maintenance workers, 22.2% of workers in food preparation and serving, and 40.8% of maids and housekeepers but only 14.3% of all employed persons. Thus, the average group representation ratio for Hispanics was 2.52.

Because our pretest participants merely nominated typical roles, our method does not allow us to determine how accurately they could estimate the magnitude of groups’ overrepresentation. However, for our purposes this comparison of pretest participants’ beliefs about groups’ typical roles with objective BLS data on groups’ representations in roles is critical; this test showed that participants nominated occupations in which group members are actually overrepresented. Thus, our role data, on the whole, reflect realistic observations of groups’ typical occupational roles. In addition, these results add to past research demonstrating group-level stereotype accuracy (e.g., 
            Jussim, 2005, 
            2012; 
            Ryan, 2002) by showing that perceivers are generally accurate in identifying the typical occupational roles of many social groups.

The oral and written instructions indicated that the survey pertained to how society views common groups in America. To circumvent social desirability pressures, the instructions stressed that participants should not give their personal beliefs but their beliefs about how the general public views these groups.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In Study 1a, each community participant rated either 2 groups or 2 roles, counterbalanced for order. In Study 1b, students rated 13 groups and their 3 corresponding roles in a one-hour small group session. In this sample, each participant rated Black men, Black women, White men, and White women, and 9 additional groups along with each group’s associated roles. The 9 groups were half of the remaining 18 groups, which had been split so that each participant received one or the other of these halves. Groups and roles were placed into 2 random orders, which were also reversed for half of the participants, with the caveat that the roles associated with a group were not placed immediately before or after the group. In Study 1c, student participants rated all 22 groups but only the top 2 of their corresponding roles so that participants would have enough time to rate all groups and their corresponding roles, allowing a completely within-subjects design. Groups and roles appeared in 2 random orders that were also reversed for half of the participants. There was no distinction between groups and roles from the participants’ viewpoint because both groups and roles were referenced as “groups” within all questionnaires; also, groups and roles were rated by different participants in the community sample.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Measures</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">To provide measures of group and role stereotypes, participants rated the attributes of groups and roles using a 7-point scale in response to the question, “As viewed by society, how typical are the following attributes of this group?” The items were selected from 
            Fiske et al. (2002) and 
            Diekman and Eagly (2000) to represent traits conveying communion, agency, and competence. The items varied slightly across the participant samples. In all factor analyses reported in this article, the measures were derived by submitting the items to maximum likelihood factor analysis with promax rotation and then inspecting the scree plot, eigenvalues, and variance accounted for. Because the correlations between group stereotypes and role attributes were computed at the mean level, these factor analyses were calculated on the mean-level ratings for groups and roles.

We refer to the second factor as agency/competence because it includes both types of traits. The ratings of roles yielded a very similar two-factor solution accounting for 89.23% of the variance resulting in identical scales for (a) communion (α = .97) and (b) agency/competence (α = .95). Negative communion items (complaining, nagging, and gullible) were eliminated from the analysis because they did not form a coherent factor.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In Study 1b, accounting for 92.06% of the variance in ratings of groups, the factors for groups were (a) communion (kind, warm, good-natured, sincere, nurturing, tolerant; α = .98) and (b) agency/competence (assertive, dominant, confident, aggressive, competent, intelligent; α = .98).

The group and role variables were empirically distinct, given that group stereotypes were impressions of each group (e.g., senior citizens), whereas role attributes were impressions averaged across the ratings of each group’s 2 or 3 most typical roles (e.g., store clerks or cashiers, store greeters, and volunteers).

This claim is strengthened by our replication across three data sets testing the relation between groups and roles. Although the method was basically the same across these studies, it differed in several ways. The groups and roles used in each study were somewhat different, as were the number of roles matched to each group (see 
          Table 1). In addition, in the community sample of Study 1a, groups and roles were rated by different participants, whereas in the student samples of Study 1b and Study 1c groups and roles were rated by the same participants. Also, the specific traits used to represent communion and agency/competence varied somewhat across the three studies. Lastly, the data sets represented two different regions of the United States and student samples as well as a community sample. The fact that our results were highly consistent across three different samples with somewhat different methods and measures gives us confidence in the robustness of these findings.

However, evidence of accuracy does not completely rule out the interpretation that people’s perceptions of role attributes are driven in part by the stereotypes of the groups typically in those roles. Thus, to address this issue, we conducted another study in which participants rated the attributes of roles based on a list of the behaviors accomplished within each occupation, presented without any occupational label. The stereotypical meanings of these role behaviors were then correlated with the group stereotype data from Study 1 to see if role attributes that are less likely to be influenced by group stereotypes still relate to these stereotypes.</p><a id="psp-107-3-371-EBDDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The data were collected through Mechanical Turk (see

<a href="http://www.onetonline.org/" target="_blank">http://www.onetonline.org/</a>), which is sponsored by the U.S. Department of Labor and developed by the National Center for O*NET Development and frequently updated. For over 900 occupations, the site provides a detailed list of tasks that job incumbents rated for their importance (
            Van Iddekinge, Tsacoumis, &amp; Donsbach, 2002). To create lists of behaviors for the current study, we used the core tasks rated 75 or higher (on a 100-point scale). We accepted as many as 8 tasks, if available, and at least 3 tasks, which required in 2 instances using some tasks with a rating lower than 75. In one case (legislators—used for the role of politicians), no importance ratings were available, and so we used our judgment in choosing among the listed tasks. In addition, for some occupational roles without a matching occupation in O*NET OnLine, we combined tasks from several relevant occupations (e.g., for the role of manager, behaviors were from general and operations, marketing, and construction managers; for the role of teacher, behaviors were from elementary, middle, and secondary school teachers). If a behavior indicated the name of the occupation, we deleted or reworded it to avoid the name (e.g., for taxi drivers, the word “taxicabs” in “drive taxicabs, limousines, or privately owned vehicles to transport passengers,” became “cars”). As an example of the behavior lists resulting from these procedures, the following are the behaviors for food service or fast food workers:

        Nauta, 2010). Occupations’ RIASEC scores are based on data pertaining to the characteristics of people who work in the occupation, work activities, skill requirements, and work contexts (see 
        Gottfredson &amp; Richards, 1999). For each occupation, O*NET OnLine provides an occupational interest profile consisting of numerical ratings on each of the 6 RIASEC types, which describes how descriptive and characteristic each type is for that work environment (
        Rounds, Armstrong, Liao, Lewis, &amp; Rivkin, 2008; 
        Rounds, Smith, Hubert, Lewis, &amp; Rivkin, 1999). To convert these RIASEC types to the traits on which we represented stereotypes, our study participants rated the 6 occupational interest types on communion and agency/competence traits. We then used the occupational interest profiles from O*NET OnLine to weight the relevance of these stereotypic traits for each RIASEC type for each of the occupational roles used in Study 1. These role attributes based on RIASEC ratings were then correlated with the group stereotype data from Study 1 to see if these role attributes, derived from an independent source and converted to communion and agency/competence scores, still predicted group stereotypes.

We related the data gathered from this sample to the stereotype data from Study 1b, because both were student samples.

            The O*NET Content Model, n.d.), without their names or occupational labels (i.e., the only words presented appear within quotation marks in the next paragraphs), were portrayed to the participants as types of work activities: 

            
<br /><ul><li><i>Realistic occupations</i> “frequently involve work activities that include practical, hands-on problems and solutions. They often deal with plants, animals, and real-world materials like wood, tools, and machinery. Many of the occupations require working outside, and do not involve a lot of paperwork or working closely with others.”
                </li><li><i>Investigative occupations</i> “frequently involve working with ideas, and require an extensive amount of thinking. These occupations can involve searching for facts and figuring out problems mentally.”
                </li><li><i>Artistic occupations</i> “frequently involve working with forms, designs and patterns. They often require self-expression and the work can be done without following a clear set of rules.”

                </li><li><i>Conventional occupations</i> “frequently involve following set procedures and routines. These occupations can include working with data and details more than with ideas. Usually there is a clear line of authority to follow.”
                </li></ul></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Measures</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">To assess role attributes, participants rated the extent to which attributes are required for each type of work, using a 7-point scale to respond to question, “To what extent would the following attributes be required to do this type of work?” This rating was slightly different than in the other studies: Instead of a typicality rating usually used for stereotypes, the participants judged the attributes required for work of this type. We changed the rating slightly because participants might have had difficulty rating the typicality of people doing the work based on such short descriptions. Because these data were correlated with group stereotypes from Study 1b, the same factor structure was used: (a) communion (kind, warm, good-natured, sincere, nurturing, tolerant; α = .99) and (b) agency/competence (assertive, dominant, confident, aggressive, competent, intelligent; α = .92).</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Each of the 6 RIASEC descriptions thus gained a communion score (realistic 
            <em>M</em> = 3.82, investigative 
            <em>M</em> = 3.34, artistic 
            <em>M</em> = 3.31, social 
            <em>M</em> = 6.14, enterprising 
            <em>M</em> = 4.46, conventional 
            <em>M</em> = 3.41) and an agency/competence score (realistic 
            <em>M</em> = 4.43, investigative 
            <em>M</em> = 5.13, artistic 
            <em>M</em> = 4.48, social 
            <em>M</em> = 4.53, enterprising 
            <em>M</em> = 5.82, conventional 
            <em>M</em> = 4.26). To create role attribute ratings based on these occupational interests, we then calculated a communion and agency/competence score for each occupational role by weighting the communion and agency/competence RIASEC ratings by the occupational interest profile (from O*NET OnLine) of the 6 RIASEC types for each occupation. For example, food service and fast food workers had an occupational interest profile of 78 for realistic, 0 for investigative, 6 for artistic, 39 for social, 50 for enterprising, and 95 for conventional. These profile ratings were multiplied by the communion and agency/competence ratings for artistic, conventional, enterprising, investigative, realistic, and social occupations, respectively. These scores were then added together and divided by the sum of the profile ratings to create a weighted average that represented the communion and agency/competence attributes for the role of food service and fast food workers. When a single matching occupation was missing in O*NET OnLine (for engineers, factory workers, middle-level managers, skilled manual laborers, and teachers), we averaged the occupational interest profiles of the occupations used to create the behavior lists in Study 2. We used the same occupational interest profile for both the middle-level manager and business professional roles.
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">After computing the weighted communion and agency/competence scores for each role, we then averaged the ratings for the 3 typical roles identified by the Preliminary Study that were used in Study 1b for each group to create typical role attributes scores based on the interest descriptions, which we call 
            <em>role RIASEC communion</em> and 
            <em>role RIASEC agency/competence</em>. There were some occupations (drug dealers, entrepreneurs, grocery baggers, homemakers, retired persons, small business owners, store greeters, students, unemployed, and volunteers) without a listing in O*NET OnLine, which had to be dropped, so the typical role averages for groups with these roles included only 1 or 2 roles.

We used only the Pearson 
          <em>r</em>, as the ICC is appropriate only for measurements that have the same metric and variance (
          McGraw &amp; Wong, 1996), which is not true of the weighted role RIASEC scores and group stereotypes. As predicted by social role theory, the associations between the groups’ stereotypes and the attributes of their typical roles based on the occupational interest profile were strong and significant (see 
          Table 3). Group communion correlated with role RIASEC communion, and group agency/competence correlated with role RIASEC agency/competence. Group agency/competence also correlated with role RIASEC communion, which could be due to the correlation between role RIASEC communion and agency/competence within this method of weighted scoring (see 
          <a id="b-fn3"> </a><sup>Footnote 3</sup>). A partial correlation between role RIASEC communion and group agency/competence, controlling for role RIASEC agency/competence, was not significant, 
          <em>r</em>(17) = −.04, 
          <em>p</em> = .87, whereas a partial correlation between role RIASEC agency/competence and group agency/competence controlling for role RIASEC communion was significant, 
          <em>r</em>(17) = .79, 
          <em>p</em> &lt; .001. In addition, role RIASEC communion was correlated with role communion from Study 1b, 
          <em>r</em>(20) = .44, 
          <em>p</em> = .04; and role RIASEC agency/competence was correlated with role agency/competence from Study 1b, 
          <em>r</em>(20) = .90, 
          <em>p</em> &lt; .001.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">As in previous studies, to determine whether group stereotypes would correspond to role RIASEC ratings not selected as typical of the group, we also computed correlations between 5 sets of randomly matched group stereotypes and role RIASEC sets. Generally, these correlations were low, and none of the predicted correlations was statistically significant in the expected direction. Averaged across the 5 correlations (using Fisher’s 
          <em>z</em> transformation) of the random sets, the correlations were not significantly different from 0—between group communion and role RIASEC communion, 
          <em>r</em> = .01, 
          <em>Z</em> = 0.91, 
          <em>p</em> = .93, and between group agency/competence and role RIASEC agency/competence, 
          <em>r</em> = −.06, 
          <em>Z</em> = −0.57, 
          <em>p</em> = .57.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">These data are consistent with Study 1 and help to refute the claim that the correlations found in Study 1 or Study 2 appeared because role attributes were influenced by group stereotypes. In Study 3, participants rated only the attributes required for the 6 types of occupational interests, not specific occupations. In addition, these same ratings of the 6 occupational types created the scores for every occupational role, weighted by the occupational interest profile for that role. Despite some approximations (i.e., for roles without a specific match in O*NET OnLine and the loss of roles such as homemaker), the correlations were quite strong. Here, as in Study 2, the correlation with role attributes was weaker for communion than for agency/competence, perhaps because communion is more difficult to ascertain from the formal descriptions of occupational behaviors or interests (which focus on tasks to perform, and not the social relationships inherent in these tasks). Overall, however, these results show that perceptions of occupational roles, removed from any occupational names, are still correlated with group stereotypes, consistent with social role theory.</p><a id="psp-107-3-371-EBDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_88" title="Study 4">Study 4</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Having established the relationship between group stereotypes and role behaviors, we extended these findings to address projected stereotype change and the causal impact of group members’ future social roles on the content of their likely future stereotypes. Using an experimental design, the study manipulated groups’ future social roles. In placing social roles as a cause of stereotype content, this theory presents an optimistic view of possibilities for stereotype change. Social role theory thus predicts that when a group’s social roles change, so will its stereotype content, when these new roles are perceived to require different behaviors and traits than the old roles. Thus, not all role change would result in stereotype change, but only role change that allows different traits to be inferred from behaviors. For a group to be regarded as more competent, for example, its members should acquire roles that are thought to require particularly competent behavior. Substantial changes in group members’ role occupancies should change their stereotype toward the qualities perceived to follow from their new roles, even though obtaining new roles can be difficult because of the power of current stereotypes to favor existing roles.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">One obstacle to stereotype change is groups’ lesser access to roles with demands that differ from those of their current roles. In such circumstances, new role occupants often encounter resistance. This 
        <em>role incongruity</em> between group stereotypes and the requirements of new roles fosters prejudice toward group members that lowers the likelihood of their entry into these roles (
        Eagly, 2004; 
        Eagly &amp; Diekman, 2005; 
        Eagly &amp; Karau, 2002). Backlash against people who seek or obtain new roles is thus a common occurrence (
        Rudman et al., 2012). Role incongruity prejudice is therefore an impediment to changing group stereotypes because such change requires that new roles make different demands than old roles.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Even when groups gain access to occupational (or other) roles that are perceived as making new and different demands, stereotype change is usually slow, for several reasons. For one, the initial movement of a few group members into new roles usually has little influence on their group stereotype, given the subtyping of such individuals as exceptions within their group (e.g., 
        Brewer, Dull, &amp; Lui, 1981; 
        Richards &amp; Hewstone, 2001). Another possibility limiting change in group stereotypes is that the presence of new role occupants may cause the roles to adapt to their stereotypical attributes. For example, leadership roles have gradually incorporated culturally feminine attributes, coincident with more women occupying these roles (see 
        Koenig, Eagly, Mitchell, &amp; Ristikari, 2011). These changes could stem from women entering these roles or from broader changes in technologies or organizational structures that produce new role demands (e.g., 
        Lipman-Blumen, 2000; 
        Reskin &amp; Roos, 1990). Whatever their causes, changes in role attributes toward the group stereotypes of the new role occupants would slow change in their group stereotypes.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">All in all, roles and stereotypes support one another: Typical roles foster group stereotypes, which in turn tend to disqualify group members from roles requiring different characteristics. In addition, pre-existing group stereotypes rationalize existing role distributions and justify the current social structure, slowing social change (e.g., 
        Hoffman &amp; Hurst, 1990; 
        Jost &amp; van der Toorn, 2012). Nevertheless, research by 
        Diekman and Goodfriend (2006) on women’s entry into new occupational roles suggests that once groups overcome resistance enough to become well represented in new roles, the new attributes that they gain are evaluated favorably. In other words, with sufficient movement into new roles, role occupants from formerly excluded groups can gain acceptance and favorable evaluation of their new proficiencies.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In the current study, we experimentally manipulated social roles at the group level by informing participants about future role changes likely to occur in several racial and ethnic groups (Asians, Black men, Black women, Hispanics, White men, and White women). In particular, we described our chosen six groups as having new roles in the future—the roles that participants in the Preliminary Study had identified as typical of each of the other groups. For example, depending on experimental condition, participants could learn that Black men will be overrepresented in three roles that were currently typical of one of the other five groups or, in a control condition, of their own group of Black men. We used these 6 groups because race and gender form important stereotyped groups in society, and we had already assessed their most common roles in the Preliminary Study.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">With this method, we tested if new roles would lead participants to project different stereotypes, as predicted by social role theory. In analyses of variance (ANOVAs) testing the overall impact of beliefs about roles versus groups on projected stereotypes, we expected that potential future roles would strongly influence group stereotypes, consistent with social role theory, regardless of the group’s current stereotype (a future roles main effect). Specifically, when the new roles have different implications for behavior than the old roles, the group’s stereotype should change in the direction of its experimentally assigned future roles (i.e., toward the stereotype of the group perceived as currently occupying these roles). When the new roles have similar implications for behavior, there would be no difference between stereotypes of the group in its old versus new roles, but the stereotype would still be similar to other groups in the same new roles. In essence, in this design the strongest form of social role hypothesis would predict that all groups with the same future roles would be judged equivalently; therefore, any groups effects would be small and not interact with future roles. However, we expected that the current group stereotype would not disappear completely, given the simplicity and brevity of the manipulation of future roles. Moreover, the manipulation did not mention the group’s current typical roles, which participants could think might endure, despite the addition of new roles. Thus, a weaker main effect of groups, reflecting the groups’ pre-existing stereotypes, should be obtained along with the future roles main effect. To the extent that each set of roles adds the same information to each of the prior group stereotypes and that roles are interpreted similarly regardless of the attached group, the group and future role variables would not interact. In addition to these ANOVAs, correlational analyses addressed the magnitude and direction of change for each group within each new set of roles, compared with changes predicted based on role stereotypes from Study 1.</p><a id="psp-107-3-371-ECBDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The data were collected through Mechanical Turk.

For example, demographers predict that in 25–30 years, [White men] will be more common in the occupations of [teachers, homemakers, and nurses] than would be expected based on their overall numbers in the population of the United States.

            Table 1). The pairings of each group with its current typical roles were considered control conditions, because they would elicit the present-day stereotype of that group.

Negative communion items (nagging, complaining, gullible) were eliminated from analysis to parallel the previous data, and the item “assertive” double-loaded on agency and competence and was not included in either scale.

Then, based on these earlier data, the difference between the roles for each pair of groups used in the current study was represented by an effect size statistic in the form of Cohen’s 
            <em>d</em>, calculated by dividing difference scores by the mean within-cell standard deviation for the relevant stereotype dimension based on the 6 racial and ethnic groups used in the current study. On each of the three stereotype dimensions, these effect sizes represented the

The logic was that, when occupying another group’s roles in the future, each group was expected to gain the same stereotype, which was described by that group’s roles. Positive

Group ratings showed less differentiation between stereotype ratings, with White men higher than Asians, Black men, and Hispanics, and all other groups equivalent.

This unexpected interaction may reflect participants’ ability to interpret the role of teacher (which was included in both Black women’s and White women’s roles) in multiple ways, depending on the group. For example, “Asian teachers” might have been viewed as teaching high-school math, compared to “White women teachers,” who might have been imagined as elementary school teachers, a role likely seen as requiring less intelligence. Thus, for competence (but not for communion or agency), women’s future roles evidently took on somewhat different meaning depending on the group. However, consistent with social role theory, future roles were more influential than current group stereotypes overall and for most of the groups.

Although these groups still had distinct stereotypes (i.e., the groups main effects), their future typical roles had greater influence (i.e., the future roles main effects) on all three stereotype dimensions. To test our hypothesis that the projected stereotypes of groups in future roles related to the attributes of their roles, we then correlated the mean stereotype for future roles (see the Total column in 
          Tables 4–6) with the matching typical role attributes computed from Study 1a. This analysis demonstrates, for example, whether the ratings on communion across future roles in the current data correlated with the role set’s communal attributes from Study 1a. Although there are only 6 such ratings (6 possible sets of future roles), the projected stereotypes of groups in these roles were highly correlated with the role attributes from Study 1a on communion,

        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">To test whether the direction and magnitude of the projected changes in group stereotypes from moving into new roles were similar to the expected changes, we used the actual change effect sizes in concert with the expected change effect sizes (see Method). For example, to assess stereotype change for White men in Hispanics’ roles, the expected change effect size (
          <em>d</em>) comparing competence ratings of White men’s roles to Hispanics’ roles in Study 1a was −1.19. Thus, if White men were to change to Hispanics’ roles in the future, their perceived competence should diminish, toward that of Hispanics’ roles. Actual change, comparing White men in White men’s roles to White men in Hispanics’ roles in the current data, indicated White men in Hispanics’ roles did, as expected, have lower competence ratings, with an effect size (
          <em>d</em>) of −1.80 for this difference. However, for White men in Asians’ roles, the effect size comparing competence ratings of White men’s roles with Asians’ roles in Study 1a was only 0.09. Thus, if White men were to change to Asians’ roles in the future, we would not expect their perceived competence to change because White men’s and Asian’s roles are stereotyped similarly on competence, and the actual change effect size indicates that there was, indeed, little change, with an effect size of −0.26.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">As a test of our predictions that actual change would follow expected change, we examined the relations between the magnitudes of the expected and actual changes in stereotypes. 
          Figures 1, 
          2, and 
          3 depict these expected and actual relations on each stereotype dimension. To gauge the strength of these relations, we computed the Pearson 
          <em>r</em> and ICC (again based on absolute value using a two-way mixed effects model). The Pearson 
          <em>r</em>s were large and positive, showing that expected change predicted the actual change in groups’ stereotypes on communion,

Thus, consistent with social role theory, participants looked primarily to role information to decide what the attributes of the six groups would be in the future. These results indicated that changes in roles caused changes in projected stereotypes, with the direction and amount of expected change matching actual change extremely well. Yet, these findings also underscore that not all role changes yield changes in stereotypes, but only changes to roles that make different demands than groups’ existing roles. Thus, when role attributes were similar and stereotype change was not expected, little change occurred (see 
          Figures 1–3).
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Consider the implications of these findings for the female gender stereotype, which has remained highly communal despite massive change in women’s roles in the 20th century. However, most of the movement of women from homemaking to employment has put them in occupational roles that are perceived as not especially agentically demanding but highly communally demanding. Women are thus especially poorly represented in higher level leadership roles (e.g., 
          Eagly &amp; Carli, 2007) and somewhat underrepresented in other agentically demanding occupational roles (
          Cejka &amp; Eagly, 1999). The communal demands of women’s occupations are apparent in their employment in the expanding service, educational, and health care sectors of the economy. Specifically, the six most common occupations for women in the United States are secretary and administrative assistant; registered nurse; elementary and middle school teacher; cashier; nursing, psychiatric, and home health aides; and retail salespersons (
          U.S. Department of Labor, 2010). In addition, women still perform the majority of domestic work (e.g., 
          Bianchi, Robinson, &amp; Milkie, 2006; 
          U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2013b). Therefore, it is not surprising that the partial reviews of gender stereotyping conducted so far have not yielded evidence of decreased gender stereotyping on communion or agency (e.g., 
          Lueptow, Garovich-Szabo, &amp; Lueptow, 2001). Yet, as argued by 
          Wood and Eagly (2012), women’s shift to paid employment may have elevated their perceived competence (e.g., 
          Pew Research Center, 2008) and broadened their stereotype to encompass different subgroups of women.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">One limitation of the current study is possible demand characteristics that encourage participants to use role information in describing future group stereotypes because it was the only information presented. Thus, this demonstration is artificial in that other information usually available in the real world was not presented. However, in favor of our design, role information becomes very salient in natural settings because it is repeatedly paired with multiple group members over time and in different settings and recurrently points to the behaviors that these individuals typically perform. In addition, participants could have clung to their group stereotypes despite changes in future roles if they believed that stereotypic group attributes are essential traits of group members. Yet, future research could use more naturalistic paradigms that embed role information along with other types of information in the settings of everyday life.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Another remaining question is how group members could change their roles in natural settings, despite some resistance. In some contexts, societal actions may require role distributions to change, for example, by imposing quotas for women in leadership roles (
          Dahlerup, 2013; 
          Kogut, Colomer, &amp; Belinky, 2013). Although the effects of such changes have not been extensively studied, it appears that such quota-mandated changes can cause attitudes and stereotypes to change in directions favorable to women’s continued occupancy of leader roles (
          Pande &amp; Topalova, 2013).
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Another possibility is that, to fit to a new role, group members change how they present themselves in ways that address any deficiencies implied by their existing group stereotypes. This logic is inherent in the title of 
          Steele’s (2010) book, 
          <em>Whistling Vivaldi,</em> which presents the idea that careful self-presentation (e.g., by a Black man) can reduce the likelihood that he will be unfavorably stereotyped. Changing individuals rather than social structures is consistent with American individualism, whereby causes are ascribed more to persons than situations (
          Oyserman, Coon, &amp; Kemmelmeier, 2002). Individual change is thus the focus of many U.S. social programs that seek to improve group members’ access to desirable roles through education and training.
          <a id="b-fn10"> </a><sup /> For example, because older adults are perceived as less cognitively competent than younger adults, educational programs that support their competence by imparting knowledge of new technologies are regarded as desirable for improved access to well-paying jobs (cf. 
          Berger, 2009). Likewise, when stereotypes were made salient, obese individuals and Black men used self-presentational strategies (wearing clean clothes or smiling) that negated their group stereotypes (disease or violence, respectively) and thus mitigated the prejudices they might otherwise encounter (
          Neel, Neufeld, &amp; Neuberg, 2013). In addition, Arabs who did (vs. did not) portray themselves as warm and competent in job applications overcame their group stereotypes of low warmth and competence and thus were more likely to be called for a job interview (
          Agerström, Björklund, Carlsson, &amp; Rooth, 2012). In general, behaving in ways that negate unfavorable group stereotypes lessens prejudice and discrimination and thereby helps to move individual group members into new roles.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Once many members of a group have moved into new social roles, overcoming these obstacles, perceivers’ observations of the group should change, resulting in a change in stereotypes, as shown in the current data. Although we argue that the relationship between typical roles and group stereotypes is an important causal link, we also acknowledge that it is embedded within a larger set of relationships.</p><a id="psp-107-3-371-EADA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_124" title="General Discussion">General Discussion</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Our research provides the first test of social role theory as a general theory of stereotype content. From this perspective, role behaviors in local contexts constitute the elementary observations that produce group stereotypes. Occupational roles, broadly defined to include unpaid and illegitimate occupations, provide especially important observations because they differentiate groups from one another more than family roles, for example. Moreover, these roles and their occupants are highly visible in everyday life through direct observation and media exposure. The traits that perceivers infer from group members’ role behaviors generalize from roles to groups because group membership is confounded with role occupancies. In the current research, groups’ stereotypes were predicted remarkably well from the traits associated with their typical social roles. Attesting to the power of this demonstration, the design of the correlational studies not only assessed stereotypes across a wide range of groups but also demonstrated robustness by using slightly different methods in each study. The results comprised strong, consistent relations between group stereotypes and role attributes (Studies 1a, 1b, and 1c), attributes of role behaviors (Study 2), and attributes of role occupational interests (Study 3). In addition, Study 4 supported a causal relationship between beliefs about typical roles and group stereotypes, with projected stereotypes changing depending on the typical roles that groups are presumed to occupy in the future. Actual change in stereotypes was strongly related to expected change, based on the new social roles attributed to the groups. Overall, these results support social role theory’s predictions about the origins of stereotypes and the conditions under which stereotypes change.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The plausibility that observations of social roles create stereotypes is enhanced by our demonstration that beliefs about groups’ typical roles have a substantial component of accuracy. Although it is possible to argue that social perceivers’ ideas about groups’ social roles might also reflect inferences from stereotypic attributes to likely roles, we think that this process is less plausible than correspondent inference from role behavior to groups’ attributes, given the ready access that social perceivers have to information about the social roles commonly occupied by most social groups. Social perceivers have no reason to guess about the distributions of groups into roles that they observe on a daily basis—for example, Hispanics mowing lawns, gay men styling hair, and poor people working in fast food or having no job at all. As our data showed, such observations are in fact generally accurate depictions of groups’ role occupancies; for most social groups, blatant inaccuracy about groups’ roles would be challenged by everyday observations. In addition, the data in Studies 2 and 3 showed that the relationship between group stereotypes and role attributes holds when role attributes are based on role behaviors or even on occupational interest profiles, which are conceptually distinct from specific occupational labels that could allow participants to reason from their knowledge of which groups are commonly represented in the occupation. Finally, the experimental data in Study 4 as well as past research on social role theory (e.g., 
        Eagly &amp; Steffen, 1986) demonstrate the causal relationship from roles to stereotypes.
      </p><a id="psp-107-3-371-EBADA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Dimensionality of Stereotypes</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Consistent with our correlational studies, stereotypes are often represented with a two-dimensional stereotype structure (e.g., 
          Abele &amp; Wojciszke, 2007; 
          Fiske, Cuddy, &amp; Glick, 2007; 
          Judd et al., 2005). However, Study 4 yielded three stereotype dimensions: communion, agency, and competence. Thus, the specific stereotypes from Study 4 are not exactly comparable to the stereotypes from the correlational studies because of their different factor structure. This three-factor solution is interesting in light of how researchers have operationalized agentic and competent traits. Stereotype researchers, following the precedent of 
          Fiske et al. (2002), have usually labeled this dimension 
          <em>competence</em> and represented it mainly by adjectives such as intelligent and competent. Competence has emerged as important for stereotypes of national and ethnic groups (e.g., 
          Phalet &amp; Poppe, 1997). In contrast, investigators of gender stereotypes have typically labeled this dimension as 
          <em>agency</em> or 
          <em>instrumentality</em> and represented it mainly by adjectives such as assertive and competitive (e.g., 
          Abele, 2003; 
          Eagly &amp; Steffen, 1984) because it is mainly agency that differentiates stereotypes of men and women, not competence (
          Cejka &amp; Eagly, 1999; 
          Newport, 2001; 
          Pew Research Center, 2008; 
          Williams &amp; Best, 1990). In addition, on a theoretical and empirical basis, competence can also pair with warmth and nurturance (cf. 
          Brambilla, Sacchi, Castellini, &amp; Riva, 2010), as it did in the two-factor solution in Study 4.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">These considerations concerning gender stereotypes clarify why the factor structure differed across our studies. Our measure of agency/competence included both types of traits in our correlational studies, which dealt with a wide variety of social groups. However, agency and competence separated into two factors in Study 4, probably because of the greater emphasis on gender stereotypes given that 4 of the 6 groups involved gender distinctions.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In addition, there are specific stereotypic attributes associated with particular groups that are not well represented by this two dimensional stereotype structure. For example, 
          Reyna, Dobria, and Wetherell (2013) found that stereotypes of immigrants often go beyond these two dimensions: Canadians were judged as passive, Mexicans as family oriented, Arabs as religious, and Chinese as socially awkward. Although our research focuses on communion and agency/competence stereotypes, as has other research, social role theory could also apply to these other types of unique stereotypes. Social roles create stereotypes because of their implications for behavior, whereby these behaviors are seen by others and generalized into stereotypes through correspondent inference. Thus, social perceivers use occupational and other types of social roles to organize behaviors into more general concepts that describe the everyday behaviors that occupants of those roles enact. Trait-specific stereotypes outside of communion and agency/competence could be created in the same way, through unequal representation of groups into the roles or specific behaviors that demonstrate these traits, in the manner that social perceivers observe disproportionate representation of African Americans in many sports and thus stereotype African Americans as athletic. Future research should continue to explore contextual variability of the dimensionality of stereotypes and the adequacy of two dimensions to represent stereotype content across many groups.
        </p><a id="psp-107-3-371-EAADA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Theories of Stereotype Content</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Our research supports the social role theory claim that correspondent inference from group members’ typical role behaviors to their group stereotypes is a key process that creates stereotypes. This principle that stereotypes stem from observations of individual group members is generally consistent with some other theories about the creation of beliefs about groups. For example, 
          Ridgeway’s (2006; 
          Ridgeway &amp; Erickson, 2000) status construction theory suggests that social perceivers’ observations of behavior in local interactional contexts where members of one group exert more influence than members of another group create beliefs about the greater competence and worthiness of members of the more influential group. These beliefs are shared and become consensual group stereotypes. In addition, 
          Fiedler and Walther (2004) argued in their cognitive-environmental theory of stereotyping that the structure of the environment can create stereotypes through observation and learning even without any motivated or biased processing by social perceivers. The social environment is structured by social roles into which members of social groups are nonrandomly distributed. This confounding of roles and group memberships creates group stereotypes by the ubiquitous psychological processes of learning and correspondent inference whereby role attributes are ascribed to social groups.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Social role theory has a different emphasis than theories emphasizing molar correlates of groups’ stereotypes such as groups’ status, intergroup relations, or access to resources, but it is nevertheless not inconsistent with these theories. For example, 
          Fiske et al.’s (2002) stereotype content model asserts that stereotype content derives from people’s perceptions of two aspects of intergroup relations. In this approach, groups’ high status evokes stereotypes of competence and groups’ cooperative interdependence evokes stereotypes of warmth (e.g., 
          Eckes, 2002; 
          Fiske et al., 2002). Similarly, 
          Alexander et al. (1999) posited that patterns of intergroup relations, including status, power, and goal compatibility, underlie stereotypes.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The compatibility of our role approach with these intergroup perspectives stems from the effects of social roles on intergroup relations. Specifically, occupational roles are highly influential in determining adult status (
          Jackman &amp; Jackman, 1983; 
          Treiman, 1977). Also, occupational roles can foster interdependence with other groups that is cooperative (e.g., teachers, social workers) or competitive (e.g., lawyers, business executives). However, in contrast to theories that emphasize broad, molar social structural correlates of stereotypes, social role theory focuses on perceivers’ more elementary, commonplace observations of group members in their typical roles, which occur through direct observation and indirectly through exposure to a wide variety of media. We think it likely that the critical information that social perceivers notice consists of the everyday activities that they observe carried out by members of social groups. For example, they observe mentally disabled individuals working as grocery baggers, women caring for babies and teaching elementary school, White men leading corporations and numerically dominating the Congress, the rich working as lawyers and corporate executives, and so forth. Therefore, the relationships between groups’ representations in occupational roles and overall group stereotypes are understandably strong. Had it been practical for our research to encompass additional classes of social roles—for example, leisure and recreational roles—our findings may have been even stronger.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Stereotype formation may differ for groups that are rarely observed (e.g., inhabitants of remote nations). If social role information is not available, molar cues may provide information that affects stereotypes. In particular, nationality stereotypes are predicted by perceptions of likability, power, and conflict among nations, most likely related to salient international events (
          Phalet &amp; Poppe, 1997). For example, Americans students’ very negative stereotype about Iranians in 
          Eagly and Kite’s (1987) study probably reflected the highly publicized hostage crisis in which Iranians had held Americans captive for 444 days in 1979–1981. To understand the content of different types of stereotypes, research should address the relative importance of molar cues pertaining to social structure and international relations versus observations of specific social roles.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">To understand the roots of social stereotypes and possibilities for changing them, social psychologists should explore stereotype content with insights from varied theoretical perspectives. As many social psychologists have argued, the perception of individuals based on their group membership restricts their opportunities and creates prejudice in some contexts. To understand how to ameliorate such negative effects, content theories should be explicit about the informational sources of stereotypes’ specific content as well as the social psychological processes that enable stereotyping. Our research provides strong support for the social role theory of stereotyping in relation to a wide range of groups and thereby provides guidance concerning how stereotypes can be changed.</p><a id="psp-107-3-371-R" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_138" title="Footnotes">Footnotes</a></span><a id="fn1" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><sup>1</sup> Based on the categories available in the BLS data, 20-somethings were defined as a combination of the age ranges 20–24 and 25–35 and middle-aged/baby boomers were classified as a combination of the age ranges 45–54 and 55–64.

          McGraw &amp; Wong, 1996). These coefficients have an upper bound of 1 but no lower bound (
          Nichols, 1998). Thus, the ICC can be negative, and negative coefficients indicate a lack of agreement rather than an inverse relationship.

The average individual-level correlations were tested against the standard normal distribution under the null hypothesis that the average correlation is zero (D. A.
