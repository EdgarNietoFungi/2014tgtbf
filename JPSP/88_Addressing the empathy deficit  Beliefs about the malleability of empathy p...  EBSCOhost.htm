Yet, empathy frequently breaks down when it is difficult or distressing to relate to people in need, suggesting that empathy is often not felt reflexively. Indeed, the United States as a whole is said to be displaying an empathy deficit. When and why does empathy break down, and what predicts whether people will exert effort to experience empathy in challenging contexts? Across 7 studies, we found that people who held a malleable mindset about empathy (believing empathy can be developed) expended greater empathic effort in challenging contexts than did people who held a fixed theory (believing empathy cannot be developed). Specifically, a malleable theory of empathy—whether measured or experimentally induced—promoted (a) more self-reported effort to feel empathy when it is challenging (Study 1); (b) more empathically effortful responses to a person with conflicting views on personally important sociopolitical issues (Studies 2–4); (c) more time spent listening to the emotional personal story of a racial outgroup member (Study 5); and (d) greater willingness to help cancer patients in effortful, face-to-face ways (Study 6). Study 7 revealed a possible reason for this greater empathic effort in challenging contexts: a stronger interest in improving one’s empathy. Together, these data suggest that people’s mindsets powerfully affect whether they exert effort to empathize when it is needed most, and these data may represent a point of leverage in increasing empathic behaviors on a broad scale.

We thank Gregory Walton for his helpful comments on an earlier version of this article.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><blockquote>The biggest deficit that we have in our society and in the world right now is an empathy deficit.—Barack Obama, 2006</blockquote></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">For over a decade, President Obama has urged Americans to cultivate a sense of empathy. He argues that we currently suffer from an empathy deficit—a widespread inability to stand in someone else’s shoes and see the world through their eyes. He has even characterized this empathy deficit as a more pressing problem than the very large federal deficit.
        <a id="b-fn1"> </a><sup /></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">A recent meta-analytic examination of American college students suggests that Obama’s description of an empathy deficit may reflect real changes in our culture (
        Konrath, O’Brien, &amp; Hsing, 2011; see also 
        Twenge, Campbell, &amp; Freeman, 2012). This analysis of 72 samples showed that self-reported empathy has declined over the last 30 years, and the decline is substantial: Between 1979 and 2009, scores on both the affective (i.e., emotional sharing and responding) and cognitive (i.e., understanding perspectives and emotions) subcomponents of empathy have decreased by 48% and 34%, respectively.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">This observed decline in empathy runs counter to many popular theories of empathy, which suggest that empathy—especially the affective component of empathy—is largely automatic and innate (e.g., 
        Gallese, 2003; 
        Hatfield, Cacioppo, &amp; Rapson, 1994; 
        Hoffman, 1984; 
        Preston &amp; de Waal, 2002; 
        Smith, 1790/2002) and thus should not be susceptible to large-scale change over time. This view of empathy as automatic dominated early philosophical thinking (
        Lipps, 1903; 
        Smith, 1790/2002; 
        Vischer, 1873) and features heavily in contemporary models from a variety of psychological sub-disciplines. For example, developmental psychologists highlight the innate and primitive nature of vicarious experience (
        Bernieri, Reznick, &amp; Rosenthal, 1988; 
        Eisenberg, 1989), as reflected in the tendency for newborns to mimic their mother’s facial experiences and cry in response to other infants’ cries (
        Haviland &amp; Lelwica, 1987). Similarly, social psychologists find support for 
        <em>emotional contagion</em> (e.g., 
        Neumann &amp; Strack, 2000; 
        Wild, Erb, &amp; Bartels, 2001), the tendency for people to “automatically mimic and synchronize facial expressions, vocalizations, postures, and movements with those of another person, and, consequently, to converge emotionally” (
        Hatfield et al., 1994, p. 5). Ethologists likewise describe the sharing of other’s motor, mental, and emotional states as an automatic and adaptive mechanism that has been preserved to help members of social species attain their shared goals (
        Preston &amp; de Waal, 2002; 
        Seyfarth &amp; Cheney, 2013). Further, individual difference researchers typically assess empathy with measures that tap a hard-wired-like susceptibility to emotional cues (e.g., Emotion Contagion Scale; 
        Doherty, 1997) or stable tendencies to experience empathy for others (e.g., Interpersonal Reactivity Index; 
        Davis, 1980). Consistent with this view of empathy as hard-wired, some research suggests that sharing others’ states is at least partly heritable (e.g., 
        Knafo, Zahn-Waxler, Van Hulle, Robinson, &amp; Rhee, 2008).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Finally, though already popular, the view that empathy is largely automatic received converging physiological support following the discovery of “mirror neurons” in macaque monkeys, which fire in response to both their own actions and intentions and to the actions and intentions of others (
        Ferrari, Gallese, Rizzolatti, &amp; Fogassi, 2003; 
        Rizzolatti &amp; Craighero, 2004). These mirror neurons often seem to respond reflexively. In humans, for example, engagement of mirror properties occurs even when observers are put under cognitive load (
        Spunt &amp; Lieberman, 2013) or are not explicitly instructed to attend to the target (
        Iacoboni et al., 2005). Several neuroscientists therefore view mirror properties as part of the foundation for empathy, allowing for reflexive, non-effortful experience sharing (e.g., 
        Gallese, 2003; 
        Iacoboni, 2009). Representing this perspective, 
        Gallese (2003) stated that the “
        <em>implicit</em>, 
        <em>automatic</em>, and 
        <em>unconscious</em> process of embodied simulation enables the observer to use his/her own resources to penetrate the world of the other without the need of explicitly 
        <em>theorizing</em> about it” (p. 174, emphasis in original).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Thus, across a variety of fields, scientists have found support for their view that empathy—and especially the vicarious sharing of others’ states—often occurs automatically. However, these automatic models do not provide a full account of empathic processes (
        Zaki, 2014). Rather than reflexively feeling empathy during every social encounter, people’s experience of empathy is highly varied and context-dependent. In fact, empathy has been shown to break down in contexts where it is difficult or painful to relate to social targets, such as when people feel dissimilar to the target (e.g., 
        Mitchell, Macrae, &amp; Banaji, 2006; 
        Xu, Zuo, Wang, &amp; Han, 2009) or when they believe that empathizing will cause them personal distress and discomfort (e.g., 
        Davis et al., 1999; 
        Pancer, 1988). These types of situational fluctuations suggest that empathy is often challenging and not felt reflexively.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We propose that when faced with such empathic challenges, people can either disengage from the situation or expend empathic effort. We define 
        <em>empathic effort</em> as a willingness to invest time or energy in feeling empathy, and we argue that people can modulate their empathy experience by amplifying the amount of effort they exert. For example, they might choose to spend more time with the target, ask questions or listen to the target to increase their understanding of the target’s emotions and perspective, or consciously try to put themselves in the target’s “shoes” so that they may come to share the target’s physiological or affective states.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">These types of effortful attempts to turn up one’s empathy might help people overcome a lack of “automatic” empathy in challenging situations. Empathic effort might thus be exactly what is needed in situations where empathy is difficult to experience yet important to positive social outcomes, such as in conflict, intergroup, or helping contexts. But how can we predict when people will rise to or shrink from such empathic challenges? Here, we use mindsets of empathy—people’s beliefs regarding the malleability of empathy—as a tool for illuminating when people will and will not expend effort to feel empathy for others.</p><a id="psp-107-3-475-ELDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_13" title="Mindsets of Empathy and Empathic Effort">Mindsets of Empathy and Empathic Effort</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Past research indicates that mindsets play a powerful role in whether people will exert effort when faced with challenges. People differ in their mindsets regarding the malleability of important attributes, such as personality and intelligence (
        Chiu, Hong, &amp; Dweck, 1997; 
        Dweck, 1996). These mindsets lie along a continuum, anchored at one end by an 
        <em>entity</em> or 
        <em>fixed theory</em> (e.g., we cannot develop our intelligence) and at the other by an 
        <em>incremental</em> or 
        <em>malleable theory</em> (e.g., we can develop our intelligence). Within these two mindsets, challenge takes on very different meanings. For people with a fixed theory, challenge signals low ability, and because they believe attributes are fixed, this low ability cannot be developed (
        Dweck &amp; Leggett, 1988; 
        Mangels, Butterfield, Lamb, Good, &amp; Dweck, 2006). These people therefore tend to seek out activities or situations that confirm their ability, and disengage from activities or situations that challenge their ability. For example, people with a fixed theory of intelligence tend to avoid challenging tasks that carry the potential for poor performance and persist less in the face of difficulty or failure (
        Dweck &amp; Leggett, 1988; 
        Heine et al., 2001; 
        Hong, Chiu, Dweck, Lin, &amp; Wan, 1999; 
        Mueller &amp; Dweck, 1998; for examples of this tendency in other domains, see also 
        Beer, 2002; 
        Carr, Dweck, &amp; Pauker, 2012; 
        Kammrath &amp; Dweck, 2006; 
        Rattan &amp; Dweck, 2010).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">For someone with a malleable theory, however, challenge signals an opportunity to improve upon one’s current limitations (
        Heine et al., 2001; 
        Hong et al., 1999; 
        Mueller &amp; Dweck, 1998; see also 
        Carr et al., 2012). These people therefore tend to engage in behaviors that will help them develop their abilities, such as approaching or persisting at challenging tasks and expending effort to improve (
        Beer, 2002; 
        Carr et al., 2012; 
        Heine et al., 2001; 
        Hong et al., 1999; 
        Mueller &amp; Dweck, 1998; 
        Nussbaum &amp; Dweck, 2008).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Like mindsets of other important attributes, we propose that people also differ in their mindsets of empathy, with some holding a fixed theory and others holding a malleable theory. Whereas individuals who hold a more fixed theory of empathy believe that people have dispositional levels of empathy that cannot be changed, individuals who hold a more malleable theory of empathy believe that people can develop their empathy.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We posit that these mindsets of empathy play an important role in how people respond to empathic challenges and thus can help us understand when people will go the extra mile to feel empathy for others. People are generally motivated to be empathic (see Pilot Study 2). When faced with barriers to feeling empathy, people might feel that their empathic abilities are being challenged. To the extent that people with a fixed theory believe empathy is inherent and unchangeable, empathic challenges might call into question their “stable” empathic abilities and conflict with their motivation to be an empathic person. They should therefore feel motivated to disengage from situations where empathy is difficult for them to experience.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">By contrast, because people with a malleable theory believe empathy can be developed, they should feel less threatened by perceiving that their empathic abilities are being challenged. When confronted with situations in which empathy is difficult for them to experience, they can attempt to overcome these challenges by expending effort. We therefore predict that people with a malleable, compared to fixed, theory of empathy will expend more empathic effort in challenging empathy situations. We anticipate that theories of empathy will matter most when empathy is challenging (i.e., in situations where people feel that it is difficult or costly to understand and relate to others), because these are the contexts in which effort is needed and which carry the risk of empathic “failure.” In this way, we hope to better understand the issue of when and why empathy fails and what can be done about it.</p><a id="psp-107-3-475-EKDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_20" title="Research Overview">Research Overview</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In seven studies, we examined whether people’s mindsets of empathy predict the amount of empathic effort they expend when faced with empathic challenges. Along the way, we both measured and experimentally varied theories of empathy, and operationalized empathic challenge in a variety of ways. We also developed novel measures of empathic effort that tap a fundamentally new approach in empathy research. Further, as noted earlier, empathy is a multifaceted construct that has both affective and cognitive components (
        Davis, 1980; 
        Zaki &amp; Ochsner, 2012). As such, we examine the effects of theories of empathy on both of these empathic components across our studies. For example, in Study 1 we assessed empathic effort using both affective items (e.g., “I try to feel what they’re feeling”) and cognitive items (e.g., “I try to see things from their perspective”). Despite this methodological diversity, our predictions were simple and constant: in all studies, we hypothesized that people with a malleable, as opposed to fixed, theory of empathy would be more likely to expend empathic effort in challenging contexts.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In Study 1, we examined correlations between participants’ theories of empathy and self-reported attempts to feel empathy when empathy is more versus less challenging. Then, in the next five studies, we tested our hypothesis in three contexts in which empathy is both challenging and crucial to positive social outcomes. Specifically, in Study 2, we examined whether participants’ theories of empathy were associated with greater willingness to invest empathic effort toward a person with opposing views on personally important political and social issues. In Study 3, we added a non-challenging disagreement condition and replicated the association between theories of empathy and empathic effort only in the challenging disagreement condition. In Study 4, we tested the causal influence of theories of empathy in this disagreement context by inducing either a fixed or malleable theory of empathy. In Study 5, we examined whether people induced to have a malleable, as opposed to fixed, theory of empathy would exert more empathic effort toward a dissimilar other (i.e., in an interracial context). Then, in Study 6, we examined whether people induced to have a malleable, as opposed to fixed, theory of empathy would exert more empathic effort when empathizing with others is potentially distressing (i.e., as with cancer patients).</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In a final study, we delved more deeply into the psychology underlying the observed effects by testing whether people with a malleable, as opposed to fixed, theory of empathy might expend more empathic effort as a means of developing their empathic abilities. We induced either a fixed or malleable theory of empathy and varied the presence of an empathic challenge by giving people either success or failure feedback on an empathy aptitude test. We examined whether a malleable (vs. fixed) theory would motivate people to try to improve their empathic abilities following the challenging failure feedback.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Our central prediction—that people with a malleable, compared to fixed, theory of empathy will exert more empathic effort in challenging contexts—requires that two preconditions be met. First, people must vary in their beliefs about the malleability of empathy, ranging from relatively fixed to malleable theories. Second, regardless of their beliefs about the malleability of empathy, people must be motivated to be empathic. That is, for people to expend empathic effort, they must want to feel empathy for others. Thus, before presenting our main studies, we present two pilot studies in which we tested these preconditions.</p><a id="psp-107-3-475-EJDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_26" title="Pilot Study 1: Do People Vary in Their Mindsets of Empathy?">Pilot Study 1: Do People Vary in Their Mindsets of Empathy?</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Before investigating whether theories of empathy predict empathic effort, we first sought to establish that people differ in their mindsets of empathy.

Five of the contexts were designed to be situations in which it is relatively more challenging to feel empathy: (1) when they disagree with someone, (2) when someone different from them is suffering, (3) when someone they do not know is suffering, (4) when they are having a problem with someone, and (5) when they are negotiating with someone. These contexts were selected because they emphasize dissimilarities between the participant and the imagined empathy target (e.g., different personal characteristics, attitudes, or goals), and past research has demonstrated that people are less empathic toward dissimilar others (e.g., 
              Batson, Duncan, Ackerman, Buckley, &amp; Birch, 1981). The other three contexts were designed to be situations in which it is relatively less challenging to feel empathy due to similarities between the participant and the imagined empathy target: (1) when they agree with someone, (2) when someone similar to them is suffering, and (3) when someone they know is suffering. For each context, participants read the description of the context (e.g., “When I disagree with someone”) and then responded to six items assessing the amount of effort they typically exert in that context (e.g., I try to: “understand their emotions”; “put myself in their shoes”; “feel what they’re feeling”). Participants responded to each of the items on a 7-point scale (1 =

We found that espousing a more malleable theory of empathy was associated with greater willingness to try to empathize (e.g., listen, try to understand, show respect) with someone who holds a conflicting view on a personally important social or political issue. However, because all participants imagined a disagreement over a personally important issue, this study only examined the association between theories of empathy and empathic effort in a challenging context, and did not contrast it to a less challenging context. In Study 3, we experimentally varied empathic challenge by randomly assigning half of participants to imagine a disagreement over a personally 
          <em>important</em> issue, and the other half to imagine a disagreement over a personally 
          <em>unimportant</em> issue. We reasoned that participants would experience greater difficulty when trying to understand or take the perspective of someone holding the opposite position on an issue they care strongly about (relative to an issue they care little about). We thus expected theories of empathy to be associated with greater empathic effort, but only when imagining a conflict over a personally important sociopolitical issue.

Past work has demonstrated that it is more challenging to empathize with members of a racial outgroup. Scholars have labeled this the “empathy gap” and have provided evidence for this gap using both behavioral and social neuroscience demonstrations (
        Cikara, Bruneau, &amp; Saxe, 2011; 
        Gutsell &amp; Inzlicht, 2010, 
        2012; 
        Hein, Silani, Preuschoff, Batson, &amp; Singer, 2010; 
        Saucier, Miller, &amp; Doucet, 2005). Unfortunately, it is in these challenging intergroup contexts where empathy might be most needed, as empathy is an important pathway to positive intergroup interactions (
        Dovidio et al., 2004; 
        Todd et al., 2011; 
        Vescio, Sechrist, &amp; Paolucci, 2003; but see 
        Vorauer &amp; Sasaki, 2009). The absence of empathy in intergroup contexts also has important negative consequences for empathy targets. For example, White jurors are less likely to empathize with Black defendants and victims, resulting in harsher punishments for Black defendants and more lenient punishments for White defendants who harmed Black victims (
        Dieter, 1998; 
        Linder, 1996). Increasing empathic effort might therefore be an effective strategy for counteracting the empathy gap, resulting in improved intergroup relations and reduced negative consequences for members of minority groups.

We found that people induced to have a malleable theory of empathy spent more time listening to the emotional personal story of a racial outgroup member. By contrast, people induced to have a fixed theory of empathy spent more time listening to the emotional personal story of a racial ingroup member. These findings may reflect the different motivational foci of people holding malleable versus fixed theories of empathy. Whereas people with a malleable theory are typically more motivated by learning goals and may thus be more likely to regard the challenging intergroup context as an opportunity for growth, people with a fixed theory are typically more motivated by validation goals and may thus be more likely to regard the less challenging ingroup context as an opportunity to demonstrate (to themselves or others) their capacity for empathy. This is consistent with past research demonstrating that people with fixed, as opposed to malleable, theories of intelligence prefer to focus on material that they have already mastered and thus can use to demonstrate their intellectual capacity (
          Nussbaum &amp; Dweck, 2008).

The link between empathy and helping behavior has been studied for decades. Empathy is considered a vital pathway to altruistic, non-egoistic helping, as empathy predicts helping even when helping is challenging or costly (e.g., 
        Batson et al., 1981, 
        1988). We therefore examined whether theories of empathy would predict empathic effort in a helping context that is distressing and thus challenging. Participants were induced to have either a fixed or malleable theory of empathy and then indicated their willingness to help cancer patients in empathically effortful and non-effortful ways. We predicted that people induced to have a malleable, as opposed to fixed, theory of empathy would be more willing to help, particularly when helping required a lot of empathic effort.

Participants first read an information page titled “Coming together in the prevention and treatment of cancer,” which emphasized the need for the support of the American public in the fight against cancer. We selected cancer as the cause because we wanted it be distressing for participants to put themselves in a position to truly empathize with cancer patients. The information page described three of the most beneficial ways to support the cause: by spreading awareness about cancer, by providing social support to cancer patients, or by offering monetary donations to fund cancer research.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Participants then read that a team of postdoctoral scholars was organizing an ongoing campus-wide campaign against cancer, and that there would be three ways to help: (1)

                <em>Volunteering at a social support group on campus</em>: Volunteers will come together in a group to listen to cancer patients as they share stories about their experiences with cancer; (3) 
                <em>Volunteering at a walkathon on campus</em>: Volunteers can walk in the annual race or act as event staff in this walk to raise money for cancer research.

The number of hours that participants were willing to volunteer in the social support group comprised our measure of empathically effortful helping. We predicted that, relative to participants induced to have a fixed theory of empathy, those with a malleable theory would indicate greater willingness to volunteer in the social support group (which required the most empathic effort), but that there would be no condition differences in willingness to volunteer at the awareness booth or walkathon.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><em>Amount of money willing to donate</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Participants next imagined that they would not be able to volunteer in the campaign against cancer, but would have the opportunity to make a monetary donation to the cause if they wished.

Compared to participants induced to hold a fixed theory of empathy, those given a malleable theory of empathy were more likely to pursue an opportunity for growth after being confronted with test feedback that called into question their empathic abilities. This study thus helps us understand why people with a malleable theory might be more likely than those with a fixed theory to expend empathic effort in challenging empathy contexts: They seek to stretch themselves to overcome their limitations. This finding is consistent with past work demonstrating that people with malleable theories of different attributes have stronger learning goals and are more likely to respond to setbacks by pursuing opportunities for growth (e.g., 
          Beer, 2002; 
          Blackwell, Trzesniewski, &amp; Dweck, 2007; 
          Heine et al., 2001; 
          Hong et al., 1999; 
          Mueller &amp; Dweck, 1998; 
          Nussbaum &amp; Dweck, 2008). Encouraging the mindset that empathy can change therefore seems to foster an orientation toward learning and growth, which might then motivate effortful attempts to empathize when it is challenging to do so.
        </p><a id="psp-107-3-475-EADA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_196" title="General Discussion">General Discussion</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Empathy is central to adaptive social functioning (
        Eisenberg &amp; Miller, 1987). It predicts diverse positive outcomes, such as conflict resolution (e.g., 
        White, 1985), unprejudiced intergroup attitudes (e.g., 
        Vescio et al., 2003), altruistic helping behavior (e.g., 
        Batson et al., 1988), and lower levels of antisocial behavior (e.g., bullying; 
        Ireland, 1999). However, despite its importance and despite the many theories that posit its automatic nature, empathy is often not felt easily or automatically. We therefore proposed the concept of empathic effort and asked when and why people would be able and willing to stretch themselves to exert empathic effort in the service of feeling empathy when it was difficult. Across seven studies, we tested and found support for our hypothesis that people’s mindsets of empathy affect whether they expend effort to engage in empathy when doing so poses a challenge.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In Study 1, we found that participants holding a more malleable theory of empathy reported that they typically expend more empathic effort in contexts where empathy is challenging (e.g., when they disagree with someone or someone they do not know is suffering), and typically persist more in trying to feel empathy when they do not immediately feel it. In Studies 2–6, we found support for our hypothesis in three contexts in which empathy is both challenging and important to positive social outcomes. In Studies 2–4, we tested our hypothesis in the context of a fundamental conflict in beliefs and found that a malleable theory of empathy—whether measured (Studies 2 and 3) or experimentally induced (Study 4)—promoted more empathically effortful responses to a person with conflicting views on personally important sociopolitical issues. In Study 5, we tested our hypothesis in an intergroup context and found that people induced to have a malleable, as opposed to fixed, theory of empathy spent more time listening to the emotional personal story of a racial outgroup member. In Study 6, we tested our hypothesis in a distressing helping context and found that people induced to have a malleable, as opposed to fixed, theory of empathy exhibited greater willingness to help cancer patients in empathically effortful ways, such as listening to stories of their fights with cancer. In a final study, we found that those induced to have a malleable theory were more likely to pursue an opportunity for improvement after being confronted with evidence that they lacked empathic ability. This study provides a way of understanding mindset differences in empathic effort: Those with a malleable theory are more willing to extend themselves to learn and improve when they are not yet up to the job.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Together, these studies tell a cohesive story about how mindsets of empathy affect empathic effort. We demonstrated our effects using both measured and manipulated mindsets of empathy, different forms of empathic challenge, and both self-reported and non-self-reported outcomes. We also demonstrated our effects on diverse measures of empathic effort, including reaching across a political divide, listening to a racial outgroup member, and being willing to engage in empathically effortful helping behavior. These studies thus suggest that the effects of theories of empathy on empathic effort are powerful, arising across wide-ranging operationalizations and contexts.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">This research has important theoretical implications. First, by focusing on empathic effort, it contributes to the empathy literature by revealing a new and important piece of the empathy puzzle. It helps us understand the limits of automatic empathy and what can be done when automatic empathy breaks down or is not sufficient for the task at hand. The diminishing levels of empathy in our culture suggest that empathic effort might be more important than ever before, as it might be particularly challenging to feel empathy in the modern world. For instance, Americans are more stressed than they used to be and likely feel preoccupied with the hectic nature of their own lives (
        Cohen &amp; Janicki-Deverts, 2012; 
        Twenge, 2006). They are also less likely to live with their nuclear family (
        U.S. Census Bureau, 2013), they spend more time in distant online encounters (
        Pew Research Center, 2012), and they are more likely than ever to work in mixed-gender and mixed-ethnicity environments (
        Burns, Barton, &amp; Kerby, 2012; 
        Pew Research Center, 2013). As society changes in these directions, people may need to exert more effort to relate to and effectively empathize with others. Future research should thus continue to explore the predictors, benefits, and possibly even costs of empathic effort so that we may understand how to counter the empathy deficit by promoting empathic effort.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The present research also identifies and demonstrates the importance of a previously unexplored variable—people’s theories of empathy. It highlights the fact that people’s 
        <em>beliefs</em> about empathy—their theories about whether or not empathy can change and be developed—play a role in their empathy behavior even beyond their self-reported levels of chronic empathy. Future work might explore whether theories of empathy can promote empathic effort and downstream positive outcomes in other challenging contexts that typically benefit from empathy. For example, does a malleable theory of empathy foster empathic effort between transgressors and victims, and ultimately increase reconciliatory responses, such as apologies and forgiveness? Does a malleable theory of empathy foster educators’ empathic effort toward struggling students, and ultimately promote positive academic (and non-academic) outcomes for these students? Here, we attempted to show the broad importance of theories of empathy by examining its effects in diverse contexts. However, given the widespread benefits of empathy, it seems likely that the effects of mindsets of empathy extend far beyond the findings we have presented here.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In addition, the present research points to a possibly new and effective target for intervention. Past attempts to enhance empathy have typically used perspective-taking instructions to situationally increase empathy (e.g., 
        Batson et al., 1997; 
        Todd et al., 2011; 
        Vescio et al., 2003) or repeated training sessions that teach children and adults to be more empathic toward others (e.g., by teaching them associations between target facial expressions and emotions; 
        Feshbach &amp; Cohen, 1988; 
        Golan &amp; Baron-Cohen, 2006; 
        Hadwin, Baron-Cohen, Howlin, &amp; Hill, 1996; 
        Riess, Kelley, Bailey, Dunn, &amp; Phillips, 2012). The success of these interventions suggests that empathy is a malleable attribute that can be taught and developed. However, both of these approaches have limitations. For example, perspective-taking instructions are probably not spontaneously activated when empathy is most challenging (e.g., conflict or intergroup contexts) and might not produce long-term change. Training sessions have been shown to produce long-term change but sometimes improve specific empathy-related skills without affecting empathy more broadly (
        Golan &amp; Baron-Cohen, 2006; 
        Hadwin et al., 1996).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">A complementary approach might therefore be to target people’s 
        <em>theories</em> of empathy, which could produce long-term increases in empathy that extend across situations, particularly those that are most challenging. In Studies 4–7, we exposed participants to either a fixed or malleable theory of empathy by presenting them with an article describing scientific evidence for one theory or the other. We found that these articles were successful at inducing the two theories at least temporarily, as they yielded the predicted effects on our outcomes of interest. To create lasting changes that promote long-term effects on empathic effort, an intervention could be modeled after past interventions designed to change people’s theories of intelligence (e.g., 
        Aronson, Fried, &amp; Good, 2002; 
        Blackwell et al., 2007). These interventions use multiple strategies, such as teaching a malleable theory over several sessions, offering vivid analogies to explain the idea of malleability, or asking participants to help others understand that intelligence is malleable. Future research might explore the impact of a more involved empathy mindset intervention on people’s tendencies to respond with empathic effort, particular in contexts in which empathy is both challenging and critical to positive social outcomes, such as marriage counseling or jury duty.

          Baron-Cohen, 1994; 
          Batson et al., 1988; 
          Eisenberg &amp; Miller, 1987). However, people might often not experience these benefits of empathy when it is challenging to empathize with others. Our research demonstrates that one way to respond to these empathic challenges is to expend additional effort to feel empathy. It highlights the importance of people’s mindsets of empathy in predicting this empathic effort, and thus identifies a new and potentially important way of addressing the empathy deficit.

As with all post-high school encounters, I couldn’t help but compare the person in front of me to the person I remembered. Mary was one of those unsympathetic types who didn’t really ever put herself in other people’s shoes or understand how other people felt.

For more than 25 years, the ERL has been following over 800 individuals. The researchers have been collecting elaborate data on them since childhood, including school records, many observations at home and in the laboratory, and in-depth interviews with the individuals, their family members, and close friends.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In a recent article published in the 
              <em>Journal of Personality Research</em>, Dr. Daniel Lawrence, the Director of ERL, reported the findings of their research. Dr. Lawrence concluded that “Empathy is changeable and can be influenced over time. Empathy is not stable over one’s lifetime. It can be developed and cultivated.” Dr. Lawrence shows that of the 800 individuals followed over 25 years, very few people’s overall empathy levels stayed the same as it was at the beginning of the study. Why? As Dr. Lawrence explains, “People learn and grow throughout life. Empathy is no different. It too can change. It is not always easy, but if they want to, people can shape how much empathy they feel for others. No one’s empathy is hard like a rock.”

Surprisingly, I found good consensus that all through life, people can change their own levels of empathy.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">How have these fields come to such agreement about the ability of empathy to be changed? Actually, this conclusion was reached long ago. The classic Child and Youth Engagement Study convinced the field of psychology that empathy can indeed be changed. In 1965, Henry Giroux established one of the most ambitious and exciting intervention programs ever conceived. It was designed to serve the needs of low-empathy youngsters who had previously demonstrated bullying behavior or were judged by schools, police, or welfare agencies to be “at risk” of becoming bullies. Bullying was the focus of the study, because it is a common and serious problem that is strongly predicted by a lack of empathy for others. The youngsters were 250 boys from working-class families in a densely populated area of Massachusetts. They entered the program at ages ranging from 5 to 11 and then continued in it for an average of five years.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The main research question of the intervention program was whether these children could learn to become more empathic toward others, and, as a result, stop bullying other children. Among other things, during the five years of the program, each child was paired with a social worker who visited him twice a month. The social workers taught these children about putting themselves in other children’s shoes, trying to see things from other children’s points of view, and feeling what other children are feeling.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The results of the intervention were rewarding. Compared to the youngsters who were also bullies or “at risk” but were 
              <em>not</em> in the program, those who had the intervention showed dramatic differences. Among the youngsters who were not in the program, over 60% were labeled as bullies in their high schools. In contrast, only 17% of the youngsters who were in the program were labeled as bullies in their high schools. In fact, many of the children in the program were identified by families and friends as now being highly empathic individuals.
            </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">What had changed their levels of empathy? Follow-up interviews with the participants when they were adults revealed that most attributed their empathic growth to believing that empathy 
              <em>can</em> be changed. Said one participant: “Every time I struggled with feeling empathy for someone or seeing their perspective, I remembered what I learned during the program. That���s OK, empathy can be changed. If I don’t feel empathy naturally, it doesn’t mean that I’m incapable of feeling it.”
            </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The conclusion is clear: the results from the Child and Youth Engagement Study indicate that empathy is changeable, and that understanding that it can sometimes be difficult to change is an important step to developing one’s empathy.</p><a id="psp-107-3-475-EAABACA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Lessons Learned</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">So what about my old classmate, Mary?

Dr. Lawrence concluded that “Empathy is rather fixed and develops consistently along the same path over time. Empathy might start out flexible, but after the early years, it appears to solidify into a cohesive empathy profile.” Dr. Lawrence shows that of the 800 individuals followed over 25 years, very few people’s overall empathy changed significantly from what it was at the beginning of the study. Why? As Dr. Lawrence explains, “In most of us, by a very young age, our empathy profile has set like plaster and cannot soften again. Even if we want to change our empathy and shape how much empathy we feel for others, we are not usually successful. Empathy becomes pretty hard, like a rock.”

Some of the participants expressed gratitude for the steady involvement of their social worker in their lives. Others recalled specific lessons they were taught about empathy, even though the participants were not helped by the intervention. Said one participant: “It was a terrific program.
