The present work examines regulatory outlooks within a multilayered model of personality composed of dispositional traits, characteristic goals, and life stories (narrative identity). Foregrounding the concept of narrative identity, the current study investigates how narrative themes of prevention and promotion relate to regulatory focus as expressed in dispositional traits and characteristic goals and explores the relative contribution of each layer of personality to psychological well-being and physical health. The findings suggest that dispositional traits, personal goals, and life narratives cohere loosely around the central themes of prevention and promotion. Moreover, promotion focus across layers of personality was related to higher levels of self-reported quality of life, compared to prevention focus. Illustrating the incremental validity of different layers of personality, promotion focus in life stories independently predicted psychological health above and beyond promotion focus in dispositional traits.

        Higgins, 1997) outlines the ways in which people enact goals and experience associated emotions related to attaining positive (promotion) or thwarting negative (prevention) outcomes. Within social psychology, RFT has organized a range of human behaviors across domains as diverse as economics (
        Galinsky, 2005), parenting (
        Keller, 2008), romantic relationships (
        Molden, Lucas, Finkel, Kumashiro, &amp; Rusbult, 2009), and psychopathology (
        Strauman, McCrudden, &amp; Jones, 2010). However, researchers have rarely related regulatory focus to taxonomies within the study of personality. The present work seeks to examine prevention and promotion within an integrative model of personality proposed by 
        McAdams and Olson (2010; see also 
        McAdams &amp; Pals, 2006). The model suggests that personality is expressed across three layers within a person: in dispositional traits (such as those encompassed within the Big Five framework), characteristic adaptations (such as personal goals and values), and integrative life stories (narrative identity). Foregrounding the perspective of narrative identity, the current work develops a procedure for assessing regulatory themes in the stories people tell about their lives (Layer 3 of personality) and then investigates how these themes relate to (a) dispositional traits (Layer 1) and personal goals (Layer 2) that track promotion and prevention tendencies and (b) important life outcomes such as psychological and physical health.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Like the older conception of approach–avoidance, RFT begins with the hedonic principle: People are assumed to act in ways aimed to maximize pleasure and minimize pain. But the theory adds that the pursuits of these contrasting goals are experienced in fundamentally different ways, each subsuming both approach and avoidance impulses. Promotion motivation attempts to move toward opportunities for reward and away from the absence of reward. For example, in approaching physical fitness, an individual with a promotion orientation might take up running to see if she could one day compete in a marathon, or in applying to colleges, might send applications to many “reach” schools in the unlikely chance of getting accepted to one. When making decisions, eagerness becomes the preferred detection strategy (
        Molden &amp; Higgins, 2008) for identifying targets that might further the achievement of promotion goals, producing a tendency to experience ‘false positives’ rather than missed opportunities (demonstrated in the previous example of applying to too many schools). Success at a promotion goal elicits feelings of pleasure, and failure results in sadness. Conversely, prevention motivation attempts to move away from the presence of a negative outcome and toward the preservation of its absence. A person who takes a prevention orientation to physical fitness might similarly try running but do so with the goal of preventing weight gain or preserving health or, in applying to colleges, might apply only to programs into which she is very likely to be accepted. To this end, a vigilant strategy is utilized, often resulting in more missed rewards in service of preventing losses (e.g., the chance to attend a better school). Feelings of calmness occur when prevention goals are achieved, and anxiety arises when they are thwarted.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Importantly, promotion and prevention orientations are hypothesized to operate as both situational and chronic motivations. That is, one’s tendency to pursue promotion or prevention goals can be shaped by the demands of the environment but can also exist as a more-or-less stable and persistent preference within an individual across time and situations. Research comparing effect sizes of chronic and induced motivations has suggested that they yield equivalent results (
        Lisjak, Molden, &amp; Lee, 2012). Although emphasis within social psychology has often been placed on primed or induced motivations, the acknowledgment of consistent individual differences in regulatory focus suggests a natural intersection with personality psychology.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">From the perspective of personality, one’s orientation to promotion or prevention does not appear to be readily reducible to a single trait or disposition, such as, say, “extraversion” or “achievement goals.” Instead, the dichotomy articulated in RFT may operate as an especially broad construct at multiple layers of personality functioning. McAdams and colleagues (e.g., 
        McAdams &amp; Olson, 2010; 
        McAdams &amp; Pals, 2006) have proposed a multilayer framework that conceives of personality as an individual’s unique variation on the general evolutionary design for human nature, expressed as a developing configuration of dispositional traits, characteristic adaptations, and integrative life narratives complexly situated in culture.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">According to the model, dispositional traits represent a foundational level of personality, manifest as those broad consistencies in behavior, thought, and feeling that provide a rough sketch of a person’s overall style of relating to the world as a social 
        <em>actor</em>. The most popular taxonomy for these traits is the Big Five dimensions of extraversion, neuroticism, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness to experience, which track broad individual differences that reside at Layer 1 in personality (
        Digman, 1990). Research has shown that these broad tendencies are strongly driven by genetic differences between people and likely also by epigenetic factors and the complex history of Gene × Environment interactions in a given individual’s life (
        Krueger, Johnson, &amp; Kling, 2006).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The second layer of personality speaks to the person as a motivated 
        <em>agent</em>. It specifies those characteristic goals, values, and adaptations that express what individuals want and do not want in life, as well as how they operate to achieve what they want and avoid what they do not want in particular situations, with respect to particular social roles, and in the context of particular developmental periods in life. The goals, values, plans, and projects that make up Layer 2 in personality, often grouped together under the label of “characteristic adaptations,” may be systematically related to the dispositional traits of Layer 1, but they are not reducible to those traits (
        Bauer &amp; McAdams, 2004; 
        McAdams &amp; Pals, 2006). Characteristic adaptations, moreover, often appear to be more context-dependent than broad traits and more amenable to direct influence by family, peers, neighborhoods, schools, or communities (
        McCrae et al., 2000). Among the various ways characteristic adaptations may manifest, 
        Little (1996) argued that personal goals, or personal action constructs, most clearly embody Layer 2 themes by bridging both self- and environmentally focused forms of motivated action.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The third layer of personality captures the way in which a person is an autobiographical 
        <em>author</em> of self. Beginning in late adolescence and early adulthood, individuals compose and internalize more-or-less coherent narratives of the self that aim to make sense of the past as it is reconstructed and the future as it is imagined (
        Habermas &amp; Bluck, 2000). Life stories explain, in narrative form, how individuals believe they came to be and where their life may be going in the future. Their evolving life story, or narrative identity, represents an integrative project to unify the self in time (
        McLean, Pasupathi, &amp; Pals, 2007). Moreover, life stories reveal the ways in which individuals find purpose and meaning in life experiences. Influenced by dispositional traits and characteristic goals and values, life stories also draw a good deal of their content and structure from cultural metaphors, images, and narratives—that is, from the variegated norms for life narration that prevail within a given culture during a particular historical period (
        Hammack, 2008; 
        McAdams, 2013).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In the overall model set forth by 
        McAdams and Olson (2010; see also 
        McAdams, 1994, 
        1995), then, life stories layer over characteristic goals and values, which layer over dispositional traits. It is our proposal that regulatory focus may be expressed across all three layers of personality—as trait, goal, and story—and thereby may provide an especially illuminating framework for organizing the ways individuals tend to act and feel in the social world; what they want and fear as motivated agents; and how they understand their past, present, and future as narrators of the self.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The overall project reported here begins with the third layer of personality—identity as a life story—and consists of three primary foci: (1) to compare regulatory focus across Layers 3 and 1 of personality by developing a thematic coding system for assessing individual differences in promotion and prevention themes as they appear in narratives of important autobiographical episodes (i.e., as central motifs in key scenes of narrative identity) and then to compare these themes in narrative identity with the most widely accepted taxonomy of personality traits through Big Five self-report questionnaire measures; (2) to incorporate Layer 2 by examining promotion and prevention in personal life goals, assessing how these goals relate both to the themes expressed in narrative identity and self-report scores on dispositional traits as a consideration of the coherence of personality; and (3) to examine all three manifestations of regulatory focus—promotion and prevention at the levels of trait, goal, and story—as statistical predictors of psychological and physical well-being.</p><a id="psp-106-1-169-EFDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_14" title="Goal 1: Examine Stories and Traits">Goal 1: Examine Stories and Traits</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">With respect to dispositional traits, personality psychology has a long tradition of studying things that appear similar to RFT. For example, trait-level orientation to gains versus losses has been explored through 
        Gray’s (1978) Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory (RST; see also 
        Gray &amp; McNaughton, 2008). RST asserts that organisms are equipped with neurological systems that govern the approach of rewards (the Behavioral Activation System [BAS]) and the avoidance of harm (the Behavioral Inhibition System [BIS]). Even though it was not originally proposed as a theory of personality, this framework has been used to posit that individual differences in personality emerge depending on the sensitivity and dominance of each of these systems within a person (
        Carver &amp; White, 1994). Although there is similarity between BIS/BAS and regulatory focus, 
        Cunningham, Raye, and Johnson (2005) suggested that these theories are not redundant, insisting that “self-regulatory focus is a higher order motivational state that directs focus of attention and evaluation, which in turn direct behavior, including approach or avoidance behavior” (p. 203). Indeed, results from their functional magnetic resonance imaging research provide evidence of this interaction between motivation and cognition.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Currently, the Big Five trait taxonomy is the most popular approach to capturing dispositional traits. To that end, in our attempt to link personality psychology and RFT, it serves as the best bridge between traits and regulatory focus. As far as the taxonomy is concerned, promotion and prevention focus would appear to share conceptual ground with the traits of extraversion, neuroticism, and openness to experience. Working with 
        Gray’s (1978) Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory, 
        Smillie, Pickering, and Jackson (2006) contended that extraversion (E) best captures the personality features associated with approach motivations. Those high in E have greater orientation to opportunities and potentials for reward, much like promotion focus. Those low in E, by contrast, are more attuned to potential for punishment, similar to prevention focus. Indeed, a meta-analysis of four studies including self-reports of E and regulatory focus found that scores on extraversion were correlated with higher promotion and lower prevention scores (
        Gorman et al., 2012).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Neuroticism (N), too, might be expected to relate to regulatory focus through its overlap with prevention orientation, a relationship also demonstrated in 
        Gorman et al.’s (2012) meta-analysis. Individuals high in N, like those with greater prevention orientation, experience frequent anxiety and employ vigilance to ward against perceived threats. In RST, anxiety is viewed to be a signal of threat, motivating the organism to withdraw from potential dangers in the environment and to remain especially wary and vigilant.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Finally openness to experience (O) may share conceptual space with regulatory focus. People high in O attempt to explore and understand their experiences, exhibiting intellectual curiosity, nonconformity, and a preference for novelty (
        Bates &amp; Bales, 1984; 
        McCrae, 1987). High openness and promotion focus privilege opportunities for personal growth and the pursuit of new experiences. People low in O, by contrast, prefer predictable and familiar experiences and are distrustful of change, echoing the caution conveyed in prevention focus. Consistent with this overlap, 
        Vaughn, Baumann, and Klemann (2008) demonstrated that higher O was related to increased pursuit of promotion-related goals and reduced pursuit of prevention-related goals for participants’ ratings of both actual and imagined goals.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">With respect to narrative identity, themes of prevention and promotion figure prominently in great stories from literature and from life. Stories track how personified characters formulate intentions and enact them over time, often in the face of environmental threats and social obstacles (
        Bruner, 1986). As a goal-directed agent, a story’s protagonist moves across a social and temporal landscape in an effort to attain positive and avoid negative outcomes, pursuing goals that promise rewards and herald growth and expansion on the one hand (promotion focus) and aiming to minimize punishments and assure safety on the other (prevention focus).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In an initial effort to translate features of promotion and prevention to life narratives, 
        McAdams, Hanek, and Dadabo (2013) examined themes of self-expansion (promotion) and self-control (prevention) in narrative accounts of autobiographical memories, and they related these themes to participants’ political orientations. They found that midlife adults who self-identified as strong political liberals tended to narrate important scenes in their lives in which they sought to explore, expand, articulate, discover, or fulfill the self. By contrast, those midlife adults who strongly identified as political conservatives tended to construct stories that featured self-regulation, emphasizing the protagonist’s efforts to control, tame, tamp down, or discipline the self. In addition, McAdams et al. found that themes of self-expansion (promotion) in life-narrative accounts were associated with high levels of trait O, whereas themes of self-control (prevention) were associated with low levels of O.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Building on 
        McAdams et al. (2013), the current study aims to examine themes of promotion and prevention in life stories as they are expressed in two different discursive contexts—when talking about (1) the self and (2) the environment. The coding system employed by McAdams et al. focused on the first perspective. Narrators who see the self as something to be explored and/or fulfilled express a promotion-focused understanding of self, whereas those who describe the self as something to be controlled or disciplined reveal a prevention focus. In addition, the current study proposes a second thematic dimension for promotion and prevention, aimed at how narrators describe the environment and their action within it. If the environment is seen as an opportunity for positive reward, then narrators reveal a promotion focus. If, by contrast, the environment is seen as posing threats to be avoided, then they reveal a prevention focus. Therefore, the current procedure for coding life narratives provides a more comprehensive outlook than what was initially proposed by McAdams et al. in that it examines regulatory focus as oriented both inward (toward the self) and outward (toward the environment).
      </p><a id="psp-106-1-169-EEDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_23" title="Goal 2: Add Personal Goals and Assess Coherence of Personality Across Three Layers">Goal 2: Add Personal Goals and Assess Coherence of Personality Across Three Layers</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The study of goals within personality psychology has commonly distinguished between those that focus on the attainment of positive outcomes and those concerned with the avoidance of negative ones. For example, 
        Maslow’s (1968) distinction between deficiency needs and growth needs roughly anticipated prevention and promotion orientations. Moreover, Maslow suggested that certain kinds of deficiency-based needs, such as those related to safety, must be satisfied first, before the individual can successfully pursue promotion concerns captured in esteem needs and self-actualization needs. More recently, work by 
        Elliot and Thrash (2002) has readily differentiated between approach and avoidance goals, using both questionnaires and coding of idiographic responses. They demonstrated that these goals cohered with trait-level approach and avoidance temperaments, which were composed of extraversion, positive emotionality, and BAS, on the one hand, and neuroticism, negative emotionality, and BIS, on the other. Although the approach/avoidance dichotomy does not perfectly match prevention/promotion as articulated in Regulatory Focus Theory, the work of Elliot and Thrash nonetheless provides preliminary evidence that regulatory focus orientations may span multiple levels of personality.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">With Goal 2, we added Layer 2 personality constructs—in particular, life goals—to the analysis of prevention and promotion orientations. Here, the second goal was to evaluate prevention and promotion in Layer 2 personality constructs—specifically, personal goals–and then relate them to prevention and promotion themes in life narrative (Layer 3 of personality) and dispositional traits (Layer 1). By examining these interconnections, we were thus able to assess the coherence of personality across different layers through the frame of RFT.</p><a id="psp-106-1-169-EDDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_27" title="Goal 3: Explore Regulatory Focus and Important Life Outcomes">Goal 3: Explore Regulatory Focus and Important Life Outcomes</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The traditional framing of regulatory focus does not explicitly contend that either orientation—prevention or promotion—is generally superior to the other. Rather, these motivations are seen as equally important to successful living and respectively suited to different adaptational tasks. For example, research on satisfaction in long-term relationships has found that among married couples, perceived support for both promotion and prevention goals independently predict well-being (
        Molden et al., 2009). Moreover, 
        Grant and Higgins (2003) demonstrated that both orientations affect quality of life. They found that pride in promotion achievements uniquely predicted optimism and self-reported well-being, and pride in prevention goals additionally and independently contributed to quality of life by predicting active coping and fewer depressive symptoms.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">That said, overall promotion orientation has consistently been linked to more positive constructs, such as creativity, flexibility, self-esteem, and optimism, whereas prevention orientation has been related to more negative constructs, like reduced job satisfaction and negative affect (
        Gorman et al., 2012; 
        Liberman, Molden, Idson, &amp; Higgins, 2001). Theories of well-being tend to emphasize growth and individuals’ ability to realize their potential: hallmarks of a promotion-focused orientation (e.g., 
        Ryff, 1989). For these reasons, one might expect that individuals with a chronic promotion focus orientation toward life would have a higher quality of life than those with a pervasive prevention focus. Indeed, given that neuroticism is positively correlated with prevention focus and negatively correlated with well-being, regulatory focus in traits alone might predict these relationships.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Goal 3 directly tested the relation of prevention and promotion to well-being by comparing prevention/promotion orientations across layers of personality in the prediction of perceived psychological and physical health. Doing so additionally allowed for an investigation of the incremental validity of each layer of personality in the prediction of well-being by simultaneously comparing predictive contributions of traits, goals, and life stories to valued life outcomes.</p><a id="psp-106-1-169-ECDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_32" title="Method">Method</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The data for the present work came from 163 intensive case studies of midlife adults collected as part of a longitudinal study on adult personality development. Participants were interviewed individually for approximately 2–3 hr using the Life Story Interview (
        McAdams, 2008), during which they were asked to describe five key autobiographical memories corresponding to a high point, a low point, a major turning point, a positive childhood experience, and a negative childhood experience. Participants also completed a series of self-report measures online prior to their interview, including information on demographic variables, dispositional personality traits, current personal goals, and psychological and physical health outcomes.

The majority of the sample was college educated, with 5% receiving a high school diploma, 24% attending some college, 24% graduating college, 42% having graduate education, and 5% listing “other” for highest educational attainment.</p><a id="psp-106-1-169-EACDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Measures</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Dispositional traits</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Dispositional personality traits (Layer 1) were assessed using the NEO Five-Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI; 
            Costa &amp; McCrae, 1992), a 60-item self-report measure of the Big Five traits. The NEO-FFI yields summary scores for extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness to experience. It has been shown to have robust temporal and internal reliability (
            G. Murray, Rawlings, Allen, &amp; Trinder, 2003).
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Regulatory focus in the life story</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Following procedures used in many previous studies of life stories (
            McAdams et al., 2004), participants provided detailed accounts of five key scenes within their life narrative: (1) high point, (2) low point, (3) turning point, (4) positive childhood event, and (5) negative childhood event. A key scene was defined to participants as a discrete and specific experience that stands out as particularly meaningful or important. Participants were encouraged to describe the scene fully, with the interviewer occasionally posing questions for classification or elaboration, telling what happened, who was involved, and what they were thinking and feeling. They were also asked to reflect on what the memory might say about who they are as a person. In responding, participants often wove together their descriptions of events and their reflections; thus, both elements were considered as a single unit in analyses. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim, yielding 163 richly detailed case studies, comprising well over 1,500 single-spaced pages of text for the five key scenes alone.
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Each scene was coded by the first and third authors on two dimensions reflecting regulatory focus, blind to participants’ demographics and self-report responses. Specifically, each scene was scored on a 5-point scale for the extent to which it reflected self- and environmentally focused manifestations of regulatory focus. Rather than lump together these two dimensions (self and environment), we decided to examine what we believed would be two rather different perspectives on the prevention/promotion idea. In principle, it seems that taking, say, a promotion-focused perspective on the self (privileging the idea of exploring the self rather than controlling the self) is a very different idea from taking a promotion-focused perspective on the environment (seeing the world as full of reward opportunities rather than threats). By keeping the two dimensions separate, moreover, we were able to examine empirically the extent to which the two do indeed relate to each other. Therefore, if the scores for the two dimensions proved to be highly correlated to the point of redundancy, then one might conclude that the two indices should be collapsed into one. If they turned out to be completely unrelated to each other (or even negatively correlated), one might conclude that prevention/promotion is not a thematically cohesive construct at the level of life narratives or that its two components are perhaps alternative manifestations. We initially expected that the two dimensions might be positively correlated—but to a modest degree at best.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The first dimension assessed the participants’ self-focused prevention/promotion orientation, anchored by the themes of self-control versus self-exploration (
            McAdams et al., 2013). Scenes that did not have a clear orientation or seemed irrelevant to either regulation or exploration received the middle score of 3. In order to move from the midpoint, the scene needed to contain clear examples of the story protagonist’s attempting to protect, maintain, regulate, restrict, or manage the self or, alternately, explore, examine, fulfill, grow, or express the self. Thus, scenes were coded as 1 (
            <em>very strong self-control</em>), 2 (
            <em>somewhat strong self-control</em>), 3 (
            <em>neither predominantly self-control nor self-exploration</em>), 4 (
            <em>somewhat strong self-exploration</em>), 5 (
            <em>very strong self-exploration</em>). Examples are provided in 
            Table 1. In this first dimension of regulatory focus in life narratives, therefore, the internal self can be viewed as something to either control or encourage, evoking different motivational orientations.

            <em>very strong avoidance</em>), 2 (
            <em>somewhat strong avoidance</em>), 4 (
            <em>somewhat strong approach</em>), and 5 (
            <em>very strong approach</em>). Examples are provided in 
            Table 2. In order to score as avoidance-oriented, the scene needed to contain evidence of the protagonists’ attempting to minimize threats or dangers in the environment by moving away from or avoiding negative situations (prevention focus). Approach-orientated scenes, on the other hand, contained evidence of the protagonists’ actively engaging in opportunities for reward or enhancement in the environment (promotion focus). For both approach and avoidance themes, the scene needed to show evidence of the protagonists’ actively moving toward or away from situations; merely being the recipient of positive or negative circumstances did not score on this dimension.

For all planned analyses (save descriptive statistics), thematic codes were summed across the five scenes to yield an index of the participants’ orientation to prevention or promotion concerns. Thus, interrater reliability was examined at the level of the participant, rather than the scene, yielding acceptable reliability for both control/exploration and threat/opportunity dimensions (intraclass correlation [ICC] = .75 and .80, respectively). Disagreements were discussed in order to maintain coding fidelity, and final codes were determined by averaging the scores of the two coders. Additionally, a composite variable indexing overall prevention versus promotion was created by summing scores on the two dimensions. Although several previous studies of regulatory focus have conceptualized prevention and promotion as orthogonal dimensions, we used single coding dimensions for these reasons: (1) our interest was in one’s 
            <em>relative</em> orientation to promotion or prevention, (2) promotion and prevention have been shown to be negatively correlated, and (3) it would seem very difficult to act from both a promotion and prevention orientation simultaneously (D. C. Molden, personal communication, April 4, 2012). Moreover, our reading of many life-narrative scenes from the current study and previous studies revealed that narrators rarely manage to convey, say, both self-exploration and self-control in the same account. For these reasons, a single dimension proved to be the most appropriate index for the study’s objectives.

Two coders, blind to identifying information, classified each of these goals as being prevention-focused, promotion-focused, or “other.” Due to the brevity of many of the goal responses, more granular classification of self- versus environmentally focused prevention and promotion goals was not possible.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Goals were classified as being prevention focused if they contained explicit evidence of the participants’ aiming to regulate the self or minimize threat in the environment in order to avoid negative outcomes. For example, one participant wished to “not lose too much ground in either physical health or financial status as time passes,” while another was focused on “getting my youngest child thru high school life without any trouble.”</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In contrast, goals were classified as being promotion focused if the participant demonstrated a wish to grow, develop, or explore the self or to approach new positive experiences or rewards. For example, one participant hoped to “continue to learn, especially through travel, about other people, cultures, and history,” and another was working toward “keeping myself open to new social and intellectual opportunities.”</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">It should be noted that the majority of goals did not contain clear evidence of being either promotion- or prevention-oriented and thus were coded “other.” Given the wide range of possible personal goals and our wish to be conservative in coding only goals which very clearly articulated regulatory focus, this is not surprising. Further, this frequency of goals relating to a particular theme is consistent with previous research aimed at identifying thematic codes in goals (e.g., 
            Emmons, 1991). Examples of goals coded as neither prevention nor promotion included “make more money,” “exercise more,” and “reconnect with relatives.”
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">As was done with the narratives, regulatory focus in goals was calculated at the level of the participant by summing the total numbers of prevention-focused goals and promotion-focused goals, with ICCs between coders of .76 and .57, respectively. Disagreements were discussed in order to maintain coding fidelity, and final codes were determined by averaging the scores of the two coders. To be consistent with the bipolar index of regulatory focus at the level of life narratives, the standardized score for number of prevention goals was subtracted from the standardized number of promotion goals, thus indexing relative strength of promotion versus prevention focus.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Quality of life measures</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Several self-report measures of psychological and physical health were completed as part of the online survey prior to the in-person interview and are described below.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><em>Depression symptomatology</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI;

The PWB is composed of six subscales related to psychological wellness, including self-acceptance, environmental mastery, purpose in life, positive relations with other, personal growth, and autonomy. For the present study, only a total score was used. The SWLS similarly indexes positive psychological health but focuses more on global life satisfaction, that is, the appraisal of one’s life as a whole. Both are widely used and have well-established reliability and validity.

For example, participants are asked, “During the past four weeks, have you accomplished less than you would like as a result of your physical health?” and “During the last four weeks, how much of the time has your physical health or emotional problems interfered with your social activities like visiting with friends, relatives, etc.?” Due to a computer malfunction, the final item in the questionnaire was administered incorrectly and was thus dropped from the final score.

Such an analysis is of relevance to the growing number of researchers who examine psychological themes in life-narrative accounts. In this line of work, there is a growing realization that accounts of different kinds of scenes (say, life-story high points vs. early childhood memories) are typically very different, emphasizing different content themes and structural features (
          McAdams &amp; McLean, 2013). In the current study, therefore, it is worth noting what kinds of life-narrative scenes are more likely to emphasize promotion and what kinds are more likely to emphasize prevention.

Pairwise comparisons revealed that high point scenes and positive childhood scenes contained significantly more opportunity themes than the other scenes but did not differ from each other. Additionally, low point scenes and negative childhood scenes contained significantly more avoidance themes than the other scenes but did not differ from each other.

In turn, positive childhood scenes were higher in promotion than low point and negative childhood scenes but did not significantly differ from turning points or high points. Negative childhood scenes and low points scored significantly more in the direction of prevention than the other scenes but did not differ significantly from each other.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">With regard to regulatory focus in personal goals, on average, participants had significantly more prevention-focused goals (

          <em>p</em> &lt; .01), such that individuals who achieved higher levels of education generated more promotion than prevention goals. However, there were no significant relations between overall regulatory focus in the goal composite and race, income, or gender.

In contrast, those high in extraversion utilized more promotion themes overall, highlighting opportunities in the environment. Individuals high in openness to experience recalled their lives with greater stress placed on self-exploration, using more promotion themes overall. Unexpectedly, individuals high in conscientiousness placed emphasis on opportunities in their lives, perhaps through greater conscientiousness facilitating professional and interpersonal success, giving rise to further prospects.

The results suggest that (1) the ideas of prevention and promotion cohere across the three layers of personality and (2) an emphasis on promotion focus, especially as revealed in traits and life narratives, tends to be associated with well-being.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Grounded in research on narrative identity, we first assessed the relative salience of prevention and promotion themes within the stories people tell about their lives, distinguishing between how individuals narrate features of autobiographical recollections pertaining to 
        <em>themselves</em> and features pertaining to 
        <em>their environments</em>. Using a newly developed coding system, we found that participants who narrated their lives in terms of personal growth and opportunity in the environment (promotion focus) were higher in trait-level extraversion and openness to experience, whereas those who described efforts to control the self and avoid harm in the environment (prevention focus) were higher in neuroticism.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Secondly, we examined how the full three-layer model of personality cohered around regulatory focus by adding in personal goals. The analysis revealed that individuals with more promotion-oriented goals told life stories with more promotion-focused themes, whereas individuals with more prevention-focused goals recounted prevention-focused life stories. The findings, therefore, show that episodic features of personality conveyed via recollections of the 
        <em>past</em> (life stories) reflect themes that correspond to those expressed in features of personality that project into the 
        <em>future</em> (personal goals). Moreover, higher trait neuroticism was linked to prevention goals, whereas higher trait openness to experience correlated with goals aimed at promotion-oriented endeavors.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Taken together, the findings demonstrate that an individual’s chronic orientation to prevention or promotion may be viewed as an organizing force for personality that is expressed through multiple layers, suggesting that personality can cohere around central themes. Promotion focus in personality is expressed, therefore, through high scores on the traits of extraversion and openness to experience and low scores on neuroticism, through pursuing approach-oriented goals in daily life and through articulating life stories that emphasize themes of self-exploration and the achievement of rewards in the environment. By contrast, prevention focus in personality is expressed through low scores on extraversion and openness to experience and high scores on neuroticism, through pursuing avoidance-oriented goals in daily life and through constructing life stories that emphasize themes of self-regulation and the avoidance of environmental threats. Indices of regulatory focus at all three layers of personality are positively associated with each other, but not so strongly associated as to suggest that they are redundant. Promotion and prevention thus express themselves in a variety of different ways in human personality and with respect to different levels of functioning.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Finally, examinations of the relative contributions of regulatory focus in each layer of personality for the prediction of psychological and physical health were conducted. The findings revealed that promotion focus in dispositional traits (Layer 1) significantly predicted better quality of life across all indices and that promotion-oriented themes in life stories (Layer 3) additionally contributed to overall quality of life and, specifically, to greater satisfaction with life and lower depressive symptomatology (although not to scores on 
        Ryff’s (1989) Psychological Well-Being scale or the perceived physical health, after controlling for goals and traits). This suggests that although prevention orientation certainly is necessary in the navigation of life’s challenges, individuals who are able to broadly orient toward approaching opportunities and self-growth show better overall well-being. Therefore constructing a life story that emphasizes promotion (vs. prevention) themes is associated with better quality of life even beyond regulatory focus expressed in dispositional traits (specifically, low neuroticism, high extraversion, and high openness to experience). This is in keeping with previous research suggesting that the narratives people internalize and tell about their lives influence how they perceive their world and impact psychological functioning (
        Bauer &amp; McAdams, 2004; 
        King, Scollon, Ramsey, &amp; Williams, 2000; 
        McAdams, 2001; 
        McAdams &amp; Manczak, in press.). Given the robust associations between personality traits and psychological health (e.g., 
        Caspi &amp; Shiner, 2005), this finding highlights the incremental validity of examining a multilayer model of personality in the consideration of important life outcomes.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Although greater promotion focus in personal goals was significantly related to better perceived health and marginally related to lower depressive symptom scores in zero-order correlations, once entered into a multiple regression with regulatory focus in traits and life stories, these associations diminished to trend level and nonsignificance, respectively. It may be that because goals were often described very briefly, our ability to accurately capture whether the participant was taking a promotion or prevention stance was compromised. In contrast, the stories participants told about their life experiences were highly detailed, which likely facilitated greater coding validity. Moreover, many of the goals provided were fairly stereotyped, such as “losing five pounds” or “pursuing a hobby.” They were also primarily concerned with immediate tasks facing the participant, whereas life stories and traits drew on past behavior over long periods of time. For these reasons, responses to current life goals may be less indicative of stable individual differences and instead more closely linked to contextual variables like cultural norms or current situations.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The results of the analysis for well-being also suggest that, across many indicators of quality of life, being promotion-focused is associated with better psychological and physical health. Traditional conceptualizations of RFT, however, do not assert that promotion focus should necessarily be a better orientation. Instead, both promotion and prevention are required for daily living, and good and bad outcomes are held to stem from the nature of regulatory fit rather than the regulatory orientation, per se (
        Higgins, 2000). That is, it is the complement between regulatory strategy and goal (or the match between the person and environmental demands) that determines whether a regulatory outlook is adaptive. Furthermore, failures to meet either promotion or prevention goals are believed to lead to equally undesirable outcomes—depression for promotion/ideal-self failures and anxiety for prevention/ought-self failures (
        Strauman et al., 2010).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In contrast, our results suggest that greater chronic promotion focus is associated with better psychological and physical health. Individuals with growth-focused, approach-based personality characteristics appear to be better off than those who are concerned with avoiding negative occurrences. There are several potential explanations for this finding. One possibility is that our level of analysis obscures regulatory fit. When examining regulatory fit, it is critical to understand the context in which the strategy is being enacted. That is, as prevention and promotion operate in any given situation (at the microlevel), strategy fit is likely to govern moment-to-moment well-being and happiness. However, by definition, chronic regulatory focus transcends environmental constraints. Thus, when exploring regulatory focus from a more macro, reflective stance (such as surveying one’s overall life or reporting on one’s overall personality), regulatory fit is likely to be less salient. Rather, the broad propensity to orient toward positive or negative stimuli may override momentary associations with quality of life indicators.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">It is also possible that one’s orientation to promotion or prevention is not simply a matter of preference but rather, for most people, is hierarchically constrained, mirroring taxonomies proposed by other researchers of goals and motivation. For example, 
        Maslow (1943) suggested that one needs to satisfy safety motivations before it is possible to address growth goals. Similarly, within parent–child attachment research, children’s ability to explore their environment presupposes a secure base to which they can return (
        Bowlby, 1988). The same may be true for broader regulatory orientations across the life span. Those still struggling to achieve prevention (safety) needs may not have the psychological or physical resources available to move on to promotion (growth) goals.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The present work demonstrates that Regulatory Focus Theory is a fundamental organizing principle of human behavior that can bring together diverse approaches to studying the psychological experiences of individuals while providing a window into personality coherence. Historically, personality psychologists have struggled to demonstrate both (1) 
        <em>consistency</em> in behavior across situations and over time and (2) the psychological 
        <em>coherence</em> of individual lives (
        Barenbaum &amp; Winter, 2008; 
        McAdams, 1997). The first challenge consumed a great deal of energy in the 1970s and 1980s as psychologists engaged in a protracted debate regarding the relative efficacy of “traits” versus “situations” in the prediction of behavior (
        Kenrick &amp; Funder, 1988). The very validity of the trait concept in personality psychology has always depended on the demonstration of some degree of temporal and cross-situational consistency in behavior (
        Epstein, 1979) and on the related idea that individual differences in personality constructs, such as dispositional traits, can predict such behavior (
        Roberts, Kuncel, Shiner, Caspi, &amp; Goldberg, 2007).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The challenge of coherence, by contrast, concerns the extent to which personality structure and function can be shown to demonstrate a meaningful internal patterning that organizes an individual life (
        Block, 1981; 
        H. A. Murray, 1938). The different ways that personality psychologists have addressed the issue of coherence include undertaking biographical studies of individual persons (
        Schultz, 2005); proposing structural (
        York &amp; John, 1992) and developmental (
        Loevinger, 1976) typologies that integrate multiple personality dimensions; and delineating various conditional, ipsative, intraindividual, and idiographic procedures that aim to articulate the dynamics of personality in individual lives (e.g., 
        Fleeson, 2001; 
        Mischel &amp; Shoda, 1995; 
        Mroczek, Almeida, Spiro, &amp; Pafford, 2006). The current study suggests an alternative approach, showing how cross-cutting themes in personality—in this case, prevention versus promotion—can integrate multiple dimensions of personality expression. The approach is not as tight as a typology or as in-depth as the biographical study of the individual case, but it does demonstrate that different constructs of personality, measured in very different ways and conceived as different layers of personality functioning, may be loosely integrated around broad psychological themes.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Even though regulatory focus is reflected at each of the three layers of personality, the empirical relations are not so strong as to suggest that the three layers are redundant. Narratives cannot be reduced to goals, which cannot be reduced to traits. As the results regarding quality of life highlight, moreover, life narratives provide unique predictive information beyond self-reported dispositional traits. To view chronic regulatory outlook, therefore, as monolithic is overly simplistic. Rather than deeming individuals “promotion” or “prevention” types, it is important to consider their regulatory orientation at each of the three layers of personality in order to draw the most nuanced and accurate understanding of them.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">There are several limitations to acknowledge concerning the research reported here. First, the directions of causality in associations with quality of life are unclear. It may be that individuals have equivalent objective experiences but that regulatory outlooks change their subjective experiences (with consequences for psychological and physical health). Indeed, research on stress has commonly found that it is perceived—and not objective—stress that matters most for psychosocial outcomes (e.g., 
        Cohen, Kamarck, &amp; Mermelstein, 1983; 
        Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1984). On the other hand, it is possible that individuals with worse physical and mental health are so focused on eliminating the presence of negative outcomes (i.e., prevention focused) that they have little room for promotion goals and growth stories. For example, an individual in great physical pain may be caught up in the wish to avoid that pain and thus unable to devote resources to self-exploration and seeking positive opportunities. Given the design of the present study, it is impossible to determine the direction or structure of these associations to quality of life.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Additionally, the study did not contain previously validated measures of regulatory focus, such as the Regulatory Focus Questionnaire (
        Higgins, Friedman, &amp; Harlow, 2001) or implicit measures of ideal/ought strength. Rather, we selected a broader measure of chronic individual differences, the Big Five dispositional traits, because they represent the most popular taxonomy within personality psychology. Although our coding guidelines attempted to closely mirror the theory upon which regulatory focus is built, it is not possible to gauge how similar coding scores are to self-reported prevention and promotion.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Lastly, the sample was composed of midlife American adults. We believe that using a midlife sample is especially conducive to studying life stories, as they have lived long enough to have coherent and full-bodied stories to tell and are therefore likely to show broad variation on prevention and promotion. At the same time, however, it is possible that associations between and with personality layers may not generalize to other developmental periods or other cultures. Future work should address this issue.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Despite these potential limitations, the current work is the first of its kind to investigate regulatory focus in a multilayer theory of personality. In the last two decades, regulatory focus theory has emerged as a broad and integrative way to organize an array of human behaviors and motivations. However, it has been largely ignored by personality psychology. The present work, therefore, bridges different research traditions in social and personality psychology, enhancing our understanding of both chronic regulatory outlooks and personality itself.</p><a id="psp-106-1-169-E0GC0ACA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_99" title="References">References</a></span><a id="c1" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Barenbaum,
