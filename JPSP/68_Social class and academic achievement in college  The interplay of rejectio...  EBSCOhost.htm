We hypothesized that concerns about discrimination based on one’s social class (i.e., class-based rejection sensitivity or RS-class) would be damaging to undergraduates’ achievement outcomes particularly among entity theorists, who perceive their personal characteristics as fixed. We reasoned that a perceived capacity for personal growth and change, characteristic of incremental theorists, would make the pursuit of a college degree and upward mobility seem more worthwhile and attainable. We found evidence across 3 studies that dispositionally held and experimentally primed entity (vs. incremental) beliefs predicted college academic performance as a function of RS-class. Studies 1a and 1b documented that high levels of both entity beliefs and RS-class predicted lower self-reported and official grades, respectively, among undergraduates from socioeconomically diverse backgrounds. In Study 2, high entity beliefs and RS-class at matriculation predicted decreased year-end official grades among lower class Latino students. Study 3 established the causal relationship of entity (vs. incremental) beliefs on academic test performance as a function of RS-class. We observed worse test performance with higher RS-class levels following an entity (vs. incremental) prime, an effect driven by lower income students. Findings from a 4th study suggest that entity theorists with RS-class concerns tend to believe less in upward mobility and, following academic setbacks, are prone to personal attributions of failure, as well as hopelessness. Implications for education and intervention are discussed.

        Ostrove &amp; Long, 2007; 
        Rubin, 2012), unfamiliar cultural norms (
        Stephens, Fryberg, Markus, Johnson, &amp; Covarrubias, 2012), and concerns about confirming stereotypes of low ability (
        Croizet &amp; Claire, 1998). These findings suggest that class-based stereotypes and judgments may interfere with university outcomes through some of the same mechanisms that have been identified for other stigmatized groups, such as identity threat (
        Steele, Spencer, &amp; Aronson, 2002), status-based rejection sensitivity (
        Mendoza-Denton, Downey, Purdie, Davis, &amp; Pietrzak, 2002), and belonging uncertainty (
        Walton &amp; Cohen, 2007). In the current research, consistent with these frameworks’ emergent theme that a sense of social acceptance is key to university adaptation for underrepresented students, we explore how students’ anxious expectations about being discriminated against on the basis of their social class background (i.e., 
        <em>class-based rejection sensitivity</em>) can affect their academic achievement.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Social and interpersonal concerns are important predictors of college outcomes, but students’ goal pursuit within college settings is likely to be affected by a myriad of other factors. Among these factors, students’ beliefs about whether people have the capacity to grow and change have been shown to be an important predictor of resilience and success in college, particularly in the face of academic challenges (
        Dweck, Chiu, &amp; Hong, 1995; 
        Grant &amp; Dweck, 2003; 
        Martinez &amp; Mendoza-Denton, 2011). As such, in this research we explore the interactive relationship between beliefs about the malleability of human qualities and class-based rejection sensitivity, with the specific hypothesis that entity theorists (who believe human qualities are fixed and immutable to change) who are also high in class-based rejection sensitivity may be at particular risk for underachievement in college.
      </p><a id="psp-107-1-101-EKDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_7" title="Social Class and College Experiences">Social Class and College Experiences</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Although students from higher class backgrounds have been traditionally overrepresented in higher education (
        Carnevale &amp; Rose, 2004), universities are recruiting increasing numbers of students from lower class families (
        Housel &amp; Harvey, 2009). Increased socioeconomic diversity on college campuses may bring to light class-based disparities between students and create more opportunities for students to meet peers from dissimilar social class backgrounds. Many students do not leave their home neighborhoods, which are often segregated by social class (e.g., 
        Lareau, 2003), until their college transitions. This makes college a likely place to encounter class-based differences in thought and behavior among members of one’s social network (see 
        Kraus, Piff, Mendoza-Denton, Rheinschmidt, &amp; Keltner, 2012, for review).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Social class groups (e.g., middle-class, working-class) may seem less perceptible than other social groups (e.g., gender, ethnicity), but research suggests that people can accurately infer others’ social class backgrounds from brief conversations (
        Kraus &amp; Keltner, 2009). In university settings, social class can be signaled through nonverbal social behavior (
        Kraus &amp; Keltner, 2009), differential access to technological gadgets (
        Kaufman, 2001), preferences for certain types of music (
        Snibbe &amp; Markus, 2005), and familiarity with the college environment itself (
        Langhout, Drake, &amp; Rosselli, 2009). Given the range of material, social, and cultural cues that serve as indicators of social class standing (
        Snibbe &amp; Markus, 2005; 
        Stephens, Fryberg, et al., 2012; 
        Stephens, Townsend, Markus, &amp; Phillips, 2012), college students, particularly those from lower social class backgrounds, are likely to contemplate how their social class will influence their social relationships and academic performance.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Research supports the contention that students’ social class backgrounds shape their college experiences. Lower class students report concerns about belonging or “fitting in” in higher education contexts (
        Johnson, Richeson, &amp; Finkel, 2011; 
        Ostrove &amp; Long, 2007). A meta-analysis of 35 studies on social class and university inclusion found that lower class students are less socially integrated in college than their middle-class counterparts (
        Rubin, 2012). University environments tend to embrace cultural values shaped by middle- and higher class contexts (i.e., independence and paving one’s own way) to a greater extent than those embraced by lower or working-class contexts (i.e., interdependence and being a part of a community; 
        Stephens, Fryberg, et al., 2012), and research suggests that lower class students may be more sensitive to such contextual differences (e.g., 
        Grossmann &amp; Varnum, 2011; 
        Kraus, Piff, &amp; Keltner, 2009; 
        Varnum, Na, Murata, &amp; Kitayama, 2012). In addition to having concerns about cultural fit, students may worry about their academic capability as a function of social class. Priming social class, both in absolute and in relative terms, has been found to reliably elicit stereotype threat and its associated underperformance (
        John-Henderson, Rheinschmidt, Mendoza-Denton, &amp; Francis, 2014; 
        Johnson et al., 2011). These findings underscore the idea that stereotypes associated with social class include assumptions about low intellectual capacity.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In this research, consistent with this emerging research on how social class can affect educational experiences, we propose 
        <em>class-based rejection sensitivity</em> (hereafter, 
        <em>RS-class</em>) as a psychological dynamic that captures individual differences in people’s anxious expectations about being rejected and discriminated against on the basis of their social class. Our research is informed by prior research on the effects of 
        <em>race-based rejection sensitivity</em> in college settings (
        <em>RS-race</em>; 
        Mendoza-Denton et al., 2002; 
        Mendoza-Denton, Pietrzak, &amp; Downey, 2008). RS-race among ethnic minority college students has been shown to predict a number of interpersonally mediated college outcomes, including avoidance of situations in which one might be rejected because of one’s race (e.g., review sessions, professor office hours), a decreased sense of inclusion within the university setting, and lower grades.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">A growing literature detailing the effects of rejection sensitivity on a myriad of status characteristics, including race (
        Chan &amp; Mendoza-Denton, 2008; 
        Mendoza-Denton et al., 2002); age (
        Kang &amp; Chasteen, 2009); gender (
        London, Downey, Romero-Canyas, Rattan, &amp; Tyson, 2012); and sexual orientation (
        Pachankis, Goldfried, &amp; Ramrattan, 2008), complements a literature on stereotype threat (
        Schmader, Johns, &amp; Forbes, 2008; 
        Steele &amp; Aronson, 1995) by recognizing that people can experience threat and anxiety not only over whether they might confirm negative stereotypes about their group but also over whether they will be mistreated or rejected by virtue of their group membership. The emphasis on acceptance and rejection that characterizes the rejection sensitivity literature reflects its origins in a literature on attachment processes (
        Bowlby, 1969, 
        1973, 
        1980; see 
        Downey &amp; Feldman, 1996).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Prior research has shown that the outcomes associated with the broader construct of status-based rejection sensitivity are group specific (
        Mendoza-Denton et al., 2002; 
        Mendoza-Denton &amp; Mischel, 2007). For example, among Asian Americans, the RS-race dynamic does not predict academic outcomes as it does for African Americans, given that Asian Americans’ rejection concerns are not centered around academics (instead, RS-race for this group predicts internalizing symptomatology, including self-esteem and depression; 
        Chan &amp; Mendoza-Denton, 2008). However, as reviewed above, the extant research suggests that the outcomes associated with class-based and race-based rejection sensitivity may be similar in college settings. First, historically, access to higher education has been limited for both racial minorities and lower income students (
        Carnevale &amp; Rose, 2004), suggesting that students from both of these groups may doubt whether they are fully accepted within the institution. Second, suspicions of low intelligence and of low ability figure prominently in the stereotypes of both stigmatized ethnic minorities and lower income students, potentially leading to worries about achievement as well as concerns that one’s presence in college may not be seen as fully legitimate.
      </p><a id="psp-107-1-101-EJDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_15" title="Entity/Incremental Beliefs">Entity/Incremental Beliefs</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Concurrent with our interest in the impact of students’ anxious expectations about their acceptance or rejection based on their social class, we also hypothesized that the effects of such concerns would be especially magnified among 
        <em>entity theorists,</em> or people who believe that human qualities and characteristics are fixed and immutable to change. Research shows that beliefs about the fixedness of individual qualities exist on a continuum. People who endorse entity beliefs tend to perceive fewer opportunities for people to change or develop over time (e.g., in personality, intelligence; 
        Levy, Chiu, &amp; Hong, 2006; 
        Levy, Stroessner, &amp; Dweck, 1998) and less correspondence between their personal effort and achievement outcomes (e.g., 
        Hong, Chiu, Dweck, Lin, &amp; Wan, 1999). Alternatively, individuals who endorse 
        <em>incremental beliefs</em> tend to perceive individual traits as malleable and subject to development via personal effort (
        Levy et al., 1998); such beliefs help students cope with academic challenges (
        Dweck, 2006).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The belief that one can nurture and grow one’s capacities has been shown to be a powerful predictor of academic success, likely due to the fact that these beliefs are applicable to so many of the tasks associated with getting an education. For example, students who construed difficulties during their college transitions as likely to change, as subtly encouraged by an intervention, experienced better academic performance and more stable feelings of university inclusion over time than did students in a control group, who were more vulnerable to construing difficulties as signals of enduring personal deficits (
        Walton &amp; Cohen, 2011). From learning to cope adaptively with academic setbacks such as bad grades, to persevering through difficult material, to the taking of relatively small steps (e.g., academic units) toward the attainment of a broader goal (e.g., a college degree), successful coping with the frustrations and difficulties of college is facilitated by the adoption of an incremental mindset (
        Dweck, 2006).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We were particularly interested in examining the interplay of RS-class and entity beliefs in college settings for several reasons. Receiving a college education is widely seen as a key to social and economic mobility within the United States; indeed, a belief that a college education will lead to upward mobility is the overarching narrative that justifies the cost and effort of college (
        Carnoy &amp; Levin, 1985; 
        Lazerson, 2010). Unlike other identity characteristics such as race or gender, class is potentially porous, such that students are able to move up the socioeconomic ladder through progressively better paying or more prestigious employment. Nonetheless, the very notion of upward mobility hinges on the assumption that such mobility is, in fact, both achievable and appealing. We propose that students who are entity theorists, and who additionally feel their social class is a source of stigmatization and social rejection, are at particular risk for experiencing adverse college outcomes, because the possibility of changing one’s socioeconomic status would seem not only unlikely (given an entity worldview) but also unappealing (because moving away from one’s current social class community would mean opening oneself to class-based rejection from others). Further, both entity beliefs and RS-class should lead to the perception of class-based discrimination and barriers to success as persistent, additionally reducing motivation for study. Consistent with this reasoning, 
        Destin and Oyserman (2009) found that lower income middle-school students expected higher grades and planned to invest more time in academics when they perceived college attendance as possible with financial aid versus unlikely due to cost; Destin and Oyserman explained that when students’ path to college is “open,” they perceive their effort to matter to their future outcomes. In short, students high in both entity beliefs and RS-class may feel that, in the final accounting, college is not worth the trouble and is a waste of time.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In summary, entity beliefs are applicable to a wide range of domains in college settings, from resilience in the face of negative interpersonal or academic feedback, to remaining motivated in the face of challenging tasks, to subscribing to the promise of upward mobility. Given the wide applicability of entity beliefs in college, our interest was thus in students’ generalized entity beliefs rather than entity/incremental beliefs about specific qualities, such as personality or intelligence. The lack of support and interpersonal difficulties that we theoretically expect to be associated with RS-class should magnify entity theorists’ risk for maladaptive college outcomes.</p><a id="psp-107-1-101-EIDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_21" title="Overview of Research">Overview of Research</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Using cross-sectional, longitudinal, and experimental designs, we conducted four studies to test the general hypothesis that among students with high levels of RS-class, entity (vs. incremental) theories would be damaging to academic performance. Using socioeconomically diverse student samples, in Studies 1a and 1b we tested the reliability of our Class-Based Rejection Sensitivity Questionnaire (RSQ-Class), the independence of RS-class from related constructs (e.g., objective social class, interpersonal rejection sensitivity), and the hypothesis that entity beliefs and RS-class, in tandem, would predict academic performance. In Study 2, we conducted a prospective study of lower income Latino students to assess whether RS-class and entity levels at matriculation predicted downstream academic performance. Study 3 employed an experimental priming technique to test the causal relationship of entity versus incremental beliefs on academic test performance (i.e., a mock graduate entrance exam) as a function of RS-class. Finally, in a fourth, exploratory study, we examined the phenomenology of RS-class and entity beliefs, to gain a better understanding of the construals and cognitions that characterize this interaction.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Recognizing that multiple factors influence college outcomes, we controlled for factors that might obscure the relations between our predictor and outcome variables. We assessed levels of past academic performance (i.e., college entrance exam scores). We also measured expectations of broad interpersonal rejection (i.e., RS-personal) and rejection based on ethnic group membership (i.e., RS-race) to differentiate class-based rejection sensitivity, as a predictor, from related constructs. Given the link between depressive symptoms and both rejection sensitivity (
        Ayduk, Downey, &amp; Kim, 2001) and college academic performance (
        Haines, Norris, &amp; Kashy, 1996), we accounted for students’ scores on a depression inventory. Further, we explored the role of ethnicity and social class in our results, with the expectation that students from all ethnic and social class backgrounds could experience class-based rejection sensitivity, though with less frequency than lower income students, given their underrepresented status (
        Carnevale &amp; Rose, 2004) and susceptibility to negative academic stereotypes (
        Croizet &amp; Claire, 1998; 
        John-Henderson et al., 2014).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Given the number of aforementioned covariates, we tested their contributions to our models systematically. We controlled for RS-personal in all models, as in prior work (e.g., 
        Mendoza-Denton et al., 2002, 
        2008; 
        Mendoza-Denton &amp; Page-Gould, 2008), because broad concerns about interpersonal rejection may obscure the unique effects of group-based rejection concerns. To maximize our statistical power while being mindful of sample sizes, we tested other covariates one at a time in separate regression models for smaller samples (Studies 1b and 2) and simultaneously in larger samples (Studies 1a, 3, and 4).

We tested this prediction with socioeconomically diverse student samples, as class-based rejection concerns can occur across the social class spectrum (
        Johnson et al., 2011). In Study 1a, we administered the RSQ-Class to a large sample of students, exploring its measurement properties, the independence of RS-class from objective social class, and the interactive effect of RS-class and entity beliefs on self-reported expected and current academic performance. We were interested in expected performance, given research showing a relationship between expectations of success and academic motivation (
        Destin &amp; Oyserman, 2009; 
        Salili, Chiu, &amp; Hong, 2001). For Study 1b, we examined the interactive effect of class-based rejection sensitivity and entity beliefs on academic performance using official university records. Additionally, we used these records to control for documented past academic performance.

                Downey &amp; Feldman, 1996; 
                Mendoza-Denton et al., 2002). Study participants are asked to imagine a series of interpersonal scenarios relating to their socioeconomic status or social class background. The scenarios themselves were generated from reviews of class-based rejection experiences as described in the literature and popular media (e.g., 
                Alvarez &amp; Kolker, 2001; 
                Kaufman, 2001;

                Goldman-Flythe, 2013). Pilot testing revealed six scenarios capturing a range of contexts in which class-based rejection might occur; we chose six scenarios to parallel the length of the other RS questionnaires used in this research.
              </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">For each scenario, participants indicate how anxious they are about rejection in that setting and the extent to which they expect acceptance (vs. rejection) from others based on their social class group membership. Items are structured such that anxiety over rejection is rated on a 6-point scale from 1 (
                <em>very unconcerned</em>) to 6 (
                <em>very concerned</em>) and expected acceptance from others is rated on a 6-point scale from 1 (
                <em>very unlikely</em>) to 6 (
                <em>very likely</em>). The measure itself is provided in the

                Feather, 1982) as well as research and theory on rejection sensitivity (e.g., 
                Downey &amp; Feldman, 1996), we conceptualized class-based rejection sensitivity as a “hot cognition,” (
                Metcalfe &amp; Mischel, 1999) whereby the effects of rejection expectations are amplified by one’s anxiety about the possibility of the negative outcome. Accordingly, we use the product term between expectations and anxiety to capture the notion of “hot cognitions” related to rejection. This operationalization has been widely applied to the other instantiations of status-based rejection sensitivity (
                Kang &amp; Chasteen, 2009; 
                London et al., 2012;

                2008; 
                Pachankis et al., 2008). Average scores for the expectation and anxiety subcomponents of this scale were correlated (
                <em>r</em> = −.30, 
                <em>p</em> &lt; .001). Expected acceptance items were reverse-scored and multiplied with the corresponding anxiety items for each scenario. All product terms were averaged to create a composite score for the RSQ-Class, with higher scores indicating greater class-based rejection sensitivity (
                <em>M</em> = 6.65, 
                <em>SD</em> = 3.90).

                Hong, Chiu, Dweck, &amp; Sacks, 1997; 
                Levy et al., 1998). Incremental theorists, or people who endorse incremental beliefs, perceive potential for personal development (e.g., “People can change even their most basic qualities”), while entity theorists, or people who endorse entity beliefs, perceive less potential for individual growth (e.g., “People can do things differently, but the important parts of who they are can’t really be changed”; 1 = 
                <em>strongly agree</em> to 6 = 
                <em>strongly disagree</em>). We reverse-scored four of eight items reflecting an incremental view before creating a scale average. Thus, lower scores on this continuous measure indicate greater agreement with incremental views and higher scores indicate greater agreement with entity views (
                <em>M</em> = 3.69,

We revisit the potential independent and interactive effects of objective social class in subsequent models with a larger samples (see Study 3) and, in Study 2, establish the interactive effects of interest in a sample of socioeconomically disadvantaged students.

That is, in a sample of first-year Latino college students from predominately lower income backgrounds, students who were higher in RS-class were particularly likely to exhibit reduced expected and actual academic performance when they were also high in entity beliefs. In contrast, students higher in RS-class who endorse incremental beliefs showed no reduction in actual GPA with increasing levels of RS-class and even expected higher GPAs than did students lower in RS-class.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Further, our interaction model held when accounting for RS-race, broad expectations of interpersonal rejection, depressive symptoms, and objective social class. Including SAT scores as a covariate for actual GPA yielded patterns of findings that were consistent with our hypotheses, although not significant. We return to this issue in Study 3, where we examine performance in an experimental setting while again controlling for standardized test scores. Our Study 3 experimental paradigm allowed us to establish a causal connection between entity beliefs and vulnerability to negative outcomes among those high (vs. low) in class-based rejection sensitivity.</p><a id="psp-107-1-101-ECDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_131" title="Study 3">Study 3</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">There were two primary goals in Study 3: First, we tested the causal effect of entity versus incremental beliefs on (simulated) graduate entrance exam performance as a function of RS-class levels. As such, we experimentally tested our hypothesis by situationally inducing entity or incremental beliefs, using previously validated priming procedures (
        Chiu, Hong, &amp; Dweck, 1997). Consistent with our findings from Studies 1 and 2, we hypothesized that the entity prime would harm standardized test performance among students high in RS-class. Given the relative inconsistency of the relationship between RS-class and performance among incremental theorists in our prior studies, we did not have a specific hypothesis about the effects of the incremental prime.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Second, we revisited, with a larger and more diverse sample, whether the entity/incremental primes caused divergent outcomes as a function of both RS-class and objective social class (i.e., a three-way interaction). Our rationale for continuing to test for a three-way interaction of social class, RS-class, and entity beliefs stems from research on the manner in which relatively lower and higher class individuals perceive and react to environmental and interpersonal threats. 
        Chen and Matthews (2001), for example, found that children from lower social class backgrounds were more likely than those from higher social class backgrounds to appraise ambiguous social situations as threatening or hostile. In a study of college students, lower versus higher class individuals displayed greater attunement to and mirroring of their friends’ hostile emotions (i.e., a social threat) when prompted to tease one another (
        Kraus, Horberg, Goetz, &amp; Keltner, 2011). Vigilance for social and environmental threats, though adaptive in some contexts (e.g., those that are dangerous or necessitate shared resources), may detract from students’ focus on personal achievement in college (
        Kraus, Rheinschmidt, &amp; Piff, 2012). Thus, we tested whether objective social class, in addition to class-based rejection sensitivity, contributes to variance in achievement outcomes.

These primes were adapted for the current study to reflect the breadth of the measures employed in Studies 1a, 1b, and 2. References to “personality” were changed to “personal characteristics” or “individual qualities” to mirror entity/incremental beliefs survey items such as “Everyone no matter who they are can significantly change their basic characteristics.” As a result, the entity prime (

Building on the longitudinal and cross-sectional designs of Studies 1a, 1b, and 2, we employed an experimental manipulation of temporarily held entity versus incremental beliefs to account for the possible co-occurrence of dispositionally held class-based rejection sensitivity concerns and entity beliefs. As class-based rejection sensitivity and entity beliefs were not correlated in Studies 1a (see 
          Table 2), 1b, and 2, we suspected that our effects were not driven by the co-occurrence of these variables and that a randomly assigned entity versus incremental prime would function similarly to dispositionally held entity beliefs. Indeed, we observed a negative relationship between academic outcomes and class-based rejection sensitivity in the entity priming condition only.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">This experimental study also allowed us more control over the academic performance measures, as all students received the same math exam. Our simulated graduate entrance exam could be thought of as one instance of college academic performance, and we would expect cumulative performance deficits over repeated performance situations to manifest as lower GPAs, as suggested by the patterns of Studies 1 and 2.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">No strong evidence of a buffering effect of the incremental prime was found.

The fact that we observed such strong effects for academic outcomes suggests that the interactive relationship between RS-class and entity beliefs on both expected and realized academic achievement outcomes is robust. The interactive relationship likely reflects recursive processes whereby academic underachievement further amplifies students’ existing worries about social class and ability. Despite the consistency of the findings, however, one question that remains is the phenomenology behind this interaction effect. In other words, what are the kinds of disruptive thoughts that characterize the mindsets of students who are both entity theorists and who anxiously expect class-based rejection in the university setting? As we have outlined in the introduction, we believe that students who both hold an immutable view of human qualities and are high in RS-class may be particularly vulnerable in the face of academic challenges and be unmoved by the narratives of upward mobility that otherwise motivate people to seek a college degree. To identify the specific thoughts and beliefs that may contribute to academic performance deficits among students with high class-based rejection sensitivity and entity beliefs, we undertook two strategies in a final study.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The first strategy was to collect data on a nomological net of variables that might characterize entity theorists who are also high in RS-class. First, we wanted to make sure that the variance captured by the RS-class/entity beliefs interaction is not redundant with preexisting related constructs, including belonging uncertainty (
        Walton &amp; Cohen, 2007) and dispositional optimism (
        Scheier, Carver, &amp; Bridges, 1994). In addition, we sought to establish that the interaction of interest here is not simply capturing a particular subset of domain-specific entity theories, notably about social class or about intelligence, given research suggesting that entity beliefs can be both general and domain specific (
        Dweck, 2006). Finally, we asked students directly about whether they endorsed a belief in upward mobility, as we expected such endorsement to be particularly low among entity theorists high in RS-class.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The second strategy was to have students freely describe their thoughts and feelings following an imagined academic setback; we would subsequently content code these essays for their naturally emerging thematic content. This strategy, we reasoned, would “let the data speak to us,” perhaps allowing us to uncover thought patterns that we might not have otherwise considered. We specifically focused on an academic setback scenario, because it is precisely during these moments that we expect high RS-class/high entity students to feel deflated and to question the utility of perseverance and, perhaps, of the college enterprise itself. Together, we hoped, our closed- and open-ended strategies would help us paint a broader picture of the phenomenology of RS-class and entity/incremental beliefs.</p><a id="psp-107-1-101-ECBDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Sample</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">A total of 170 undergraduates (111 female, 52 male, 7 unspecified) participated in exchange for partial course credit, as part of the research participation program at the University of California, Berkeley.

            <em>p</em> = .001), supporting the idea that attributions of personal responsibility are negatively charged for this group (see 
            Table 6). Hopelessness itself was also related to devaluing college (
            <em>r</em> = .51, 
            <em>p</em> = .009). Among incremental theorists who are low in RS-class, there was no significant relationship between attributions of personal responsibility and hopelessness (

          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Incremental theorists high in RS-class, who at times show a trend toward higher GPAs, show a positive relationship only between hopelessness and feelings of personal failure (

            <em>p</em> = .02; see 
            Table 8). We found a similar relationship between hopelessness and personal failure for entity theorists who are low in RS-class (

It is important to recognize that the open-ended nature of the study necessarily yields a greater variety of outcomes than do more closed-ended, hypothesis driven studies (e.g., Studies 1–3). We did not intend (nor should one expect) for our interaction to fully account for the reactions people might have to academic failure. Nevertheless, our exploration of the nomological net of our interactive effect provided insight into the types of beliefs that may contribute to the vulnerability of students with high class-based rejection sensitivity and entity beliefs. These students perceive the relationship between hard work and success as more tentative than their counterparts with incremental beliefs. We also established that the intersection of entity beliefs and class-based rejection sensitivity is not redundant with belonging uncertainty or dispositional optimism and that it does not strongly predict domain-specific beliefs about the malleability of social class or intelligence.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The open-ended essay themes additionally revealed that, in the face of poor academic performance, students with entity beliefs tended to attribute personal responsibility for their failure as their levels of class-based rejection sensitivity increased. Of interest, this interaction also revealed that students with low levels of class-based rejection sensitivity and incremental beliefs assume personal responsibility for their poor academic performance. We suspected that the meanings students associate with personal responsibility may differ among vulnerable students (high RS-class entity theorists) versus less vulnerable students (low RS-class incremental theorists). In the former case, personal responsibility may map onto feelings of self-blame and perceived futility of effort, an interpretation supported by the network of outcomes also associated with this cell (hopelessness, lack of belief in personal mobility). In the case of less vulnerable students, attributions of personal responsibility may instead be coupled with feelings of self-efficacy and internal locus of control. Indeed, the intercorrelation analysis shows exactly this pattern, such that attributions of responsibility are strongly associated with hopelessness specifically for entity theorists high in RS-class, but the same attributions are positively related to a belief in upward mobility through hard work and negatively related to goal disengagement for incremental theorists low in RS-class.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Taking these results together, we find that students with high levels of class-based rejection sensitivity and entity beliefs may experience academic setbacks as a reflection of obstacles and personal deficits that are stable. A belief that outcomes and opportunities will be “doomed,” not just in the near future but over the long term, could in turn lead to patterns of learned helplessness (
          Abramson, Metalsky, &amp; Alloy, 1989) as well as domain disengagement (
          Major, Spencer, Schmader, Wolfe, &amp; Crocker, 1998). Such patterns may help explain why the interactive effect of class-based rejection sensitivity and entity beliefs seems to be a consistent predictor of expected and actual college academic performance.

We found evidence of the interactive effect of class-based rejection sensitivity and entity beliefs in samples of students from various ethnic backgrounds, social class backgrounds, and class years. Further, the observed negative relationship between class-based rejection sensitivity and university outcomes among those endorsing entity beliefs (both dispositionally and postpriming) held after accounting for interpersonal and race-based rejection sensitivity, objective social class, depression symptoms, and past academic performance.</p><a id="psp-107-1-101-EDADA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Understanding Risk and Resiliency as a Function of RS-Class and Entity Beliefs</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In this research, a negative relationship between RS-class and academic achievement was consistently observed, specifically among students who endorse entity theories. Study 4 further elucidated some of the phenomenology of high RS-class entity theorists, suggesting that these students are vulnerable to feelings of hopelessness and self-blame following academic setbacks and are not as eager as other students to endorse a belief in upward mobility. Thus, we see that vulnerability to academic difficulties may be compounded by being high in both RS-class and entity theories.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">By contrast, however, the relationship between RS-class and academic outcomes was considerably more variable in association with incremental theories. Although we frequently observed no significant relationship between RS-class and academic outcomes among incremental theorists (e.g., official grades in Study 2, Study 3), in several studies RS-class tended toward being a positive predictor of academic outcomes (expected grades in Study 1a, Study 1b) and in some cases was significant (self-reported current grades in Study 1a; expected grades in Study 2; upward mobility in Study 4). These latter cases suggest that, in the presence of an incremental theory of change, sensitivity to class-based rejection may unexpectedly become a protective factor—perhaps by allowing students to feel like they can tackle the class-based disparities that they are more likely to perceive.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">This possibility notwithstanding, the strongest “signal” in these findings remains the instability of the relationship between RS-class and academic outcomes in the presence of incremental theories. This instability can perhaps be understood as being a reflection of variability in the efficacy of a protective factor (incremental theories) on buffering against a risk factor (RS-class). Whereas attenuation of the effects of a risk factor may be reasonably expected, it seems considerably less likely that a given protective factor would completely buffer or even reverse risk effects. The variability in the main effects of entity/incremental theories in the presence of the interaction (see, e.g., Study 2 vs. Study 3), as well as the lack of strong correlations for the incremental/high RS-class “cell” (see 
          Table 8), further suggests variability in the effects of the protective factor, given a vulnerability factor. The specific “dosage” conditions under which we might expect attenuation versus buffering effects of RS-class is an exciting topic for future research. Nonetheless, our strong prediction—that entity theorists who are also anxious about rejection based on their social class would be vulnerable to academic underperformance—was confirmed, along with insights into the specific phenomenology surrounding this vulnerability.

          Mendoza-Denton et al., 2002; 
          Stephens, Fryberg, et al., 2012; 
          Walton &amp; Cohen, 2007). Acceptance concerns may fuel students’ vigilance for cues that indicate whether they belong in a given setting (
          Walton &amp; Cohen, 2011). Although individuals from lower social class backgrounds express vigilance to social threats more generally (
          Chen &amp; Matthews, 2001; 
          Kraus et al., 2011), they may be especially vigilant to interpersonal and environmental cues in university settings because these settings evoke concerns about social stigmatization (
          Johnson et al., 2011). In particular, lower class college students contend with numerical underrepresentation (
          Carnevale &amp; Rose, 2004), unfamiliar cultural norms (
          Stephens, Fryberg, et al., 2012; 
          Stephens, Townsend, et al., 2012), and stereotypes about their academic ability (
          Croizet &amp; Claire, 1998).
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Our results suggest that students’ levels of class-based rejection sensitivity are important to predicting their college experiences, even beyond their objective social class standing. We expected class-based rejection sensitivity to be most prevalent and detrimental among students from lower class backgrounds; although we found a negative correlation between parental income and class-based rejection sensitivity, we did not find consistent evidence of moderation by objective social class. This could be due to insufficient power in Study 1b and to higher class students also experiencing class-based rejection sensitivity (see 
          Goldman-Flythe, 2013). We suspect that higher class students may worry about negative stereotypes in interpersonal domains (e.g., being perceived as “cold” or “spoiled”; 
          Fiske, Cuddy, Glick, &amp; Xu, 2002), and lower class students may worry about class-based discrimination more broadly, due to their traditionally underrepresented status in higher education and awareness of academic stereotypes (
          Carnevale &amp; Rose, 2004; 
          Croizet &amp; Claire, 1998). Unpacking how class-based rejection sensitivity may differ among upper and lower class students remains a fruitful area for future research.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Several studies on college students’ experiences as a function of their social class backgrounds have found that private university settings may be especially threatening for students from lower class backgrounds (
          Johnson et al., 2011; 
          Ostrove, 2003). At the large public university at which these studies were conducted, we might have expected the high numerical representation of lower income students (i.e., over one third of the student population as indexed by Pell Grant eligibility; 
          Heller, 2004) to “normalize” the experience of being from a lower class background (though see 
          Stephens, Fryberg, et al., 2012 for counter evidence). We found that students in a relatively socioeconomically diverse campus demonstrate individual differences in RS-class, though we are unable to discern how the mean and variability in RS-class levels compares to those for other 4-year universities. Future research could assess whether class-based rejection sensitivity concerns are amplified versus attenuated as a function of campus socioeconomic diversity.

College completion rates for students from the lowest income quartile show less growth than those from the highest quartile (e.g., rising from 5% to 9% vs. 36% to 54%, respectively, in birth cohorts from the early 1960s vs. the early 1980s; 
          Bailey &amp; Dynarski, 2011). Our data suggest that even though variability in RS-class meaningfully predicts academic outcomes across the social class spectrum, lower income students may be at particular risk for experiencing class-based rejection sensitivity.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The current findings suggest that one important—but not the only—component of interventions addressing class-based disparities in educational settings may be to specifically target students’ networks of beliefs around the perceived futility of their efforts to “get ahead.” We conclude that incremental belief interventions (e.g., 
          Aronson, Fried, &amp; Good, 2002) hold promise for students with high class-based rejection sensitivity. In past research, negatively stereotyped individuals who learned about incremental views of intellectual ability achieved better academic performance (
          Aronson et al., 2002; 
          Good, Aronson, &amp; Inzlicht, 2003). We suspect that these interventions could be further adapted for students with high class-based rejection sensitivity by also targeting students’ beliefs about the fixedness versus permeability of social class group boundaries and by focusing on making nonglobal attributions in the face of academic setbacks (e.g., 
          Weiner, 1985, 
          1986).
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Students’ class-based rejection concerns may interfere with their social and academic performance through other mechanisms as well. Vigilance to social threats and possible stigmatization, characteristic of class-based rejection sensitivity, likely drains attentional and self-regulatory resources. In line with this assertion, students from relatively lower versus higher class backgrounds experienced more cognitive depletion when asked to discuss stigma-relevant (i.e., academic achievement) but not stigma-irrelevant (i.e., geographic preferences) topics (
          Johnson et al., 2011; Study 3). Related research on stereotype threat, or the fear of confirming negative stereotypes about one’s group (
          Steele &amp; Aronson, 1995), demonstrates that people’s working memory capacity, which is essential to completing academic tasks, is consumed by worries about negative group-based social evaluation (
          John-Henderson et al., 2014; 
          Schmader &amp; Johns, 2003). As such, interventions aimed to attenuate social threats, including cross-group friendship interventions (
          Mendoza-Denton &amp; Page-Gould, 2008) and belonging interventions (
          Walton &amp; Cohen, 2011), could provide fruitful approaches to intervention.

          Housel &amp; Harvey, 2009), they must be aware of potential obstacles to these students’ college adaptation. Higher education has been called the “great equalizer” because of its utility as a means to social and economic mobility (
          Carnevale &amp; Rose, 2004). However, higher education remains both a gateway and a barrier to social mobility for lower class students, due to institutional, social, and psychological barriers to these students’ academic achievement. Finding ways to increase students’ sense of inclusion may help them benefit from college-based opportunities for personal and socioeconomic advancement.

          Dweck et al., 1995); however, we found similar correlations when using a median split to divide participants into cells, suggesting a robustness to the patterns across the two methods.
