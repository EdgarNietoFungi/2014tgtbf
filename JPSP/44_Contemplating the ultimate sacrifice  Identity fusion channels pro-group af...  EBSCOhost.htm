Seven experiments explored the cognitive and emotional mechanisms that underlie such endorsements. Participants responded to 1 of 2 moral dilemmas in which they could save 5 members of their country only by sacrificing themselves. Over 90% of participants acknowledged that the moral course of action was to sacrifice oneself to save others (Experiment 1), yet only those who were strongly fused with the group preferentially endorsed self-sacrifice (Experiments 2–7). The presence of a concern with saving group members rather than the absence of a concern with self-preservation motivated strongly fused participants to endorse sacrificing themselves for the group (Experiment 3). Analyses of think aloud protocols suggested that saving others was motivated by emotional engagement with the group among strongly fused participants but by utilitarian concerns among weakly fused participants (Experiment 4). Hurrying participants’ responses increased self-sacrifice among strongly fused participants but decreased self-sacrifice among weakly fused participants (Experiment 5). Priming the personal self increased endorsement of self-sacrifice among strongly fused participants but further reduced endorsement of self-sacrifice among weakly fused participants (Experiment 6). Strongly fused participants ignored utilitarian considerations, but weakly fused persons endorsed self-sacrifice more when it would save more people (Experiment 7). Apparently, the emotional engagement with the group experienced by strongly fused persons overrides the desire for self-preservation and compels them to translate their moral beliefs into self-sacrificial behavior.

          Spencer, 2008)
        </blockquote></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><blockquote>Professor Librescu died as he lived, devoted to his students and to his profession.—From a memorial to Dr. Liviu Librescu, who sacrificed his life to save his students during the April 16th, 2007, Virginia Tech campus shootings</blockquote></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">When people encounter life and death moral dilemmas, they almost invariably know what they 
        <em>should</em> do. Nevertheless, cases like Fan Meizhong’s demonstrate that 
        <em>knowing</em> does not guarantee 
        <em>doing</em>. Fan acknowledged on his blog that he knew that he should have helped his students evacuate. Yet, when the earthquake struck, he shouted “Stay calm, it’s an earthquake!” and ran for it—without even bothering to see if his pupils were following. Later, when one of his students asked for an explanation, he helpfully replied, “I have a very strong sense of self-preservation.” In contrast, when Dr. Librescu heard gunshots, he swiftly barricaded himself against the classroom door, giving his students time to escape through an open window. This act of valor cost him his life. Which raises the following question: If merely recognizing that group members are in mortal danger is not enough to motivate many people to sacrifice themselves to save others, what does compel such actions?
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In this article, we suggest that one important antecedent of self-sacrifice for one’s group is identity fusion, which denotes a visceral sense of oneness with the group. We suggest further that the sense of connection experienced by strongly fused persons triggers emotional reactions to the plight of fellow group members, emotional reactions that motivate the decision to sacrifice their lives for these group members. Weakly fused persons do not have the same emotional reactions when they learn that their fellow group members are imperiled; instead, their first impulse is to preserve their own lives. To test these possibilities, in seven investigations we explored the mental processes that unfold as people contemplate sacrificing themselves for members of their group. Identity fusion theory (
        Swann, Jetten, Gómez, Whitehouse, &amp; Bastian, 2012) provides the conceptual context for this work.
      </p><a id="psp-106-5-713-EJDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_9" title="Identity Fusion">Identity Fusion</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The identity fusion approach assumes that when people become fused with a group, they theoretically experience a visceral sense of “oneness” with that group. This sense of oneness involves the union of the personal self (viz., idiosyncratic features of the individual) and a social self (viz., features the individual shares with the group). In its embrace of the distinction between the personal and social self, identity fusion resembles “group identification,” a key variable within social identity formulations (e.g., 
        Ellemers, Spears, &amp; Doosje, 1997; 
        Postmes, Haslam, &amp; Jans, 2013; 
        Smith, Seger, &amp; Mackie, 2007). A central difference between identification and fusion, however, involves the nature of the “glue” that bonds group members to the group. Social identity formulations hold that group members are bound to one another through 
        <em>categorical</em> ties that are based on the degree to which members embody the prototypic qualities of the group; the unique relationships that group members establish with one another are not regarded as an important contributor to identification. In fact, in the widely used “minimal-group paradigm,” participants become identified with the ingroup and biased against the outgroup despite never having encountered a single member of either group (e.g., 
        Billig &amp; Tajfel, 1973; 
        Turner, Sachdev, &amp; Hogg, 1983). Not surprisingly, then, the pro-group sentiments of highly identified persons are directed toward the abstract category rather than individual members of the category (e.g., 
        Tajfel &amp; Turner, 1979; 
        Turner, Hogg, Oakes, Reicher, &amp; Wetherell, 1987).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In contrast, the relational ties principle of fusion theory (
        Swann et al., 2012) holds that strongly fused persons are not bound to the group category only, but also to their fellow group members (see also 
        Aron, Aron, Tudor, &amp; Nelson, 1991; 
        Markus &amp; Kitayama, 1991). The presence of such relational ties means that fused persons view other group members as unique individuals rather than interchangeable members of the category. These relational ties may contribute to feelings of family-like mutual obligation and shared strength. These feelings may help explain why measures of identity fusion consistently outperform measures of identification in predicting endorsement of fighting and dying for individual members of the group (
        Gómez, Brooks, et al., 2011). Mutual obligation and shared strength may also explain why, when presented with an opportunity to donate to fellow Spaniards in need of financial help, strongly fused persons donate more personal funds than weakly fused persons (
        Swann, Gómez, Huici, Morales, &amp; Hixon, 2010). Moreover, when strongly fused persons are ostracized by fellow group members, they refuse to abandon the group and instead increase their endorsement of extreme sacrifices for the group (
        Gómez, Morales, Hart, Vázquez, &amp; Swann, 2011). Further, in several versions of the trolley dilemma (
        Foot, 1967), fused persons endorsed plunging themselves in front of a speeding train to save several members of their group. In contrast, highly identified persons were generally unwilling to sacrifice themselves for ingroup members (
        Gómez, Brooks, et al., 2011; 
        Swann, Gómez, Dovidio, Hart, &amp; Jetten, 2010).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Of particular relevance to our interest in the processes that give rise to endorsement of extreme pro-group behavior, several studies showed that the effects of fusion could be amplified either by increasing people’s physiological arousal (
        Swann, Gómez, Huici, et al., 2010) or priming their personal self-views (
        Gómez, Brooks, et al., 2011; 
        Swann, Gómez, Seyle, Morales, &amp; Huici, 2009). Similarly, in one study, group-directed personal agency (e.g., “I am responsible for my group’s actions”) mediated the relationship between identity fusion and pro-group behavior (
        Gómez, Brooks, et al., 2011). In another, relational ties (e.g., “Members of my country are like my family to me”) mediated the relationship between identity fusion and endorsement of pro-group behavior (
        Swann et al., in press). In all of the foregoing research, measures of identification were relatively poor predictors of extreme pro-group outcomes and agency did not mediate the effects of identification on pro-group behavior. Together, this evidence suggests that identity fusion is qualitatively distinct from social identification (for further discussion, see 
        Buhrmester et al., 2012; 
        Gómez, Brooks, et al., 2011; 
        Swann et al., 2012).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Of particular relevance here, evidence that increasing physiological arousal amplifies the effect of fusion on pro-group behavior (
        Swann, Gómez, Huici, et al., 2010) suggests that people’s emotional responses may play a role in motivating fused persons to enact pro-group behavior, including behaviors that have moral overtones. The role of emotion in moral decision making has recently attracted the attention of several researchers. For example, after a decades-long emphasis on the impact of relatively controlled, explicit beliefs in moral judgment (
        Kohlberg, 1969; 
        Turiel, 1983), researchers have now provided evidence for the importance of automatic, intuitive processes in moral behavior (
        Blair, 1995; 
        Haidt, 2001; 
        Pizarro &amp; Salovey, 2002).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">A case in point is “moral dumbfounding,” in which people blithely endorse moral judgments that subsequent questioning reveals they have no rational basis for having made (
        Haidt, 2001). Such immediate, non-conscious, intuitive processes share many of the properties of emotional reactions. Evidence of the role of such processes in moral reasoning has persuaded several researchers to propose that two separate mental systems (
        Chaiken &amp; Trope, 1999; 
        Posner &amp; Snyder, 1975) govern moral decision making—one that is rapid, automatic, and emotion-driven and another that is deliberate and logical (e.g., 
        Greene, 2007, 
        2009; 
        Greene, Morelli, Lowenberg, Nystrom, &amp; Cohen, 2008; 
        Lombrozo, 2009). Recent evidence using 
        Jacoby’s (1991) process dissociation model has offered direct support for the operation of these dual systems. Whereas some moral judgments (viz., those involving deontological principles) were uniquely related to emotional processes such as empathic concerns and religiosity, other moral judgments (viz., those involving utilitarian principles) were uniquely related to need for cognition. Furthermore, just as a time-pressure manipulation selectively reduced adherence to utilitarian principles, an empathy enhancing manipulation selectively increased adherence to deontological principles (
        Conway &amp; Gawronski, 2013).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Here, we suggest that a dual process approach can also be used to illuminate the unique moral judgments of persons who are strongly versus weakly fused to their group. That is, insofar as fusion taps a visceral feeling of oneness with the group, threats to other group members may activate the same emotions of tension, distress, and anxiety that they would experience were they themselves in danger. Moreover, these emotional reactions should compel them to apply deontological principles to the plight of their group members and resolve to save them. Among the many who decide to sacrifice themselves, the implications of their own death should come to mind only after contemplating the plight of the group. Furthermore, if they decide 
        <em>not</em> to sacrifice themselves, they should do so while resigning themselves to find another way to save the ingroup (i.e., deny the implications of the binary options in the dilemma).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In contrast, when weakly fused persons learn that members of their group are imperiled, the relative absence of feeling one with the group will ensure that they experience minimal distress on behalf of the group members. Free of emotional reactions to the plight of the group, their immediate focus may be on how to insure their own personal survival. If they have time to reflect, weakly fused participants may go on to ask themselves if it is morally defensible to murder five ingroup members to save one person (themselves). They may conclude that it is not. As such, in those relatively rare instances in which weakly fused individuals do walk down the path to self-sacrifice, they may be prompted them to do so by carefully reasoned, utilitarian principles. To test these ideas, we developed two new intragroup versions of the trolley dilemma (
        Foot, 1967), a widely used paradigm in the moral judgment literature.
      </p><a id="psp-106-5-713-EIDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_18" title="Identity Fusion in Two Intragroup Versions of the Trolley Dilemma">Identity Fusion in Two Intragroup Versions of the Trolley Dilemma</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In previous intragroup variations of the trolley dilemma (
        Swann, Gómez, Dovidio, et al., 2010), participants first imagined that they were standing on an overpass above some train tracks. Down the tracks, they could see that five ingroup members were trapped and were about to be crushed by a runaway train. As such, participants first learned of the plight of several ingroup members (activating their social self); only after this they learned of their option to save the ingroup members by sacrificing themselves (activating their personal self). Conceivably, activating the social self prior to the personal self may have elevated the psychological potency of the social self, causing strongly fused participants to endorse pro-group behavior to a greater degree than they would have otherwise. In addition, in this dilemma, the extreme behavior (dying for the ingroup) was always the pro-group behavior.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">To determine whether fusion effects were limited by either the order in which the social self was activated or the relative extremity of the pro-group behavior, we constructed two new variations of the trolley dilemma that varied these factors. As in previous research (see 
        Gómez, Brooks, et al., 2011; 
        Swann, Gómez, Dovidio, et al., 2010), in one variation participants first learned that several ingroup members were imperiled (activating their social self) and then learned that they could save those ingroup members by placing themselves in jeopardy (activating their personal self and availing them of the possibility of enacting an extreme pro-group behavior). In a second variation, participants first learned that they themselves were in jeopardy (activating their personal self) and then learned that they could save themselves by (surreptitiously) placing several ingroup members in peril (activating their social self and availing them to the possibility of enacting an extreme anti-group behavior). In the latter variation, we expected that strongly fused persons would still be particularly inclined to endorse pro-group action, with weakly fused persons endorsing the extreme anti-group option of ensuring their own survival by placing several group members in harm’s way. In short, our new intragroup variations of the trolley dilemma tested whether fusion effects would generalize to scenarios in which the social self was activated after the personal self and in which there was an option for extreme anti-group behavior to guarantee personal survival.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We named the first of the new intragroup variations of the trolley dilemma the 
        <em>summoning the death train</em> scenario. Individual participants learned that a runaway train was about to crush and kill five ingroup members (citizens of his/her country) unless they flipped a switch that diverted the train to their own railway track, killing them but leaving the five ingroup members unharmed. Participants then chose between letting the train crush the five ingroup members or flipping the switch to sacrifice their own lives.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The second new trolley dilemma was the 
        <em>luring others to their death</em> scenario. It began by having participants imagine that they were themselves trapped on a railway track, with a deadly train hurtling their way. Then, they learned that a group of five fellow citizens was 200 m away, and if participants called them, they would come to help. Their fellow citizens were unaware, however, that upon arriving, they would become trapped between the train and the participant, saving the participant but killing them. Participants then chose between doing nothing and dying versus saving their own lives by inviting the five ingroup members into a deathtrap.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">With these two new variations of the trolley dilemma in hand, we conducted a series of seven investigations. The first three experiments examined the basic properties of the “summoning” and “luring” dilemmas. Experiment 1 was designed to provide information regarding participants’ perceptions of the morality of sacrificing oneself, versus five ingroup members, in the context of each dilemma. We expected that in adherence to widely shared social values, most participants would recognize self-sacrifice as more moral than sacrificing others to save oneself. Experiment 2 asked whether, in both dilemmas, identity fusion would influence endorsement of self-sacrifice, with strongly fused persons tending to endorse sacrificing themselves to save other ingroup members, whereas weakly fused participants would not. Experiment 3 tested our assumption that strongly fused persons endorsed self-sacrifice out of devotion to fellow group members against the rival hypothesis that they were unconcerned with self-preservation.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In the remaining four experiments, we used the new dilemmas to examine participants’ conscious thoughts and emotions while they decided whether to sacrifice themselves or members of their group. We were especially interested in the processes that underlay the tendency for strongly fused persons to endorse sacrificing themselves for ingroup members. Insofar as strongly fused persons experience a visceral feeling of oneness with other group members, when they learned that other group members were in grave danger, they should experience emotional reactions that would motivate them to save ingroup members from their plight. Even if they fail to endorse sacrificing themselves, they should resolve to find another way to save the ingroup members. In contrast, learning that members of their group are imperiled should produce relatively little group-related emotional distress among weakly fused persons. Instead, their initial impulse should be to focus on preserving their 
        <em>own</em> lives. If given enough time to reflect, some weakly fused participants may become concerned with the objectively problematic decision of endorsing the murder of five ingroup members to save themselves. They may accordingly endorse self-sacrifice. We tested these hypotheses in Experiment 4.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">One implication of the foregoing analysis is that curtailing the amount of time that people have before responding to the dilemma should magnify the differences between strongly versus weakly fused individuals. That is, if people are informed that members of their group are imperiled and required to indicate immediately whether they would sacrifice themselves to save these group members, their emotionally charged, intuited response should prevail (e.g., 
        Rand, Greene, &amp; Nowak, 2012; 
        Suter &amp; Hertwig, 2011). Specifically, hurrying participants’ responses should exaggerate the tendency for strongly fused people to endorse sacrificing themselves for ingroup members and for weakly fused people to save themselves at the expense of ingroup members. We tested these ideas in Experiment 5.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">A second implication of this analysis is that priming the personal self of participants should have opposite effects on strongly versus weakly fused persons. That is, because fused persons have a visceral sense of oneness with the group, priming the personal self should simultaneously activate both selves. If they then learn that ingroup members are imperiled, the priming manipulation should amplify their immediate emotional impulse to sacrifice themselves for the ingroup members. In contrast, because weakly fused persons lack a visceral sense of oneness with the group, priming the personal self should activate their personal self only. When they then learn that ingroup members are imperiled, the priming manipulation should amplify their impulse to focus on their own personal survival. Their willingness to engage in self-sacrifice should therefore decline (see also 
        Conway &amp; Gawronski, 2013). We tested these hypotheses in Experiment 6.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">A third implication of this analysis is that the strong relational ties that fused persons develop toward other ingroup members should prevent them from thinking of such individuals in utilitarian terms. Note that many people think that the life of even a single family member is sufficient to justify the sacrifice of their own life. Insofar as strongly fused persons develop family like ties to fellow group members, they should be just as inclined to sacrifice their lives for a single member of the ingroup as for multiple members of the ingroup. In contrast, weakly fused persons may take a relatively pragmatic view of the value of the lives of ingroup members. Rather than seeing the lives of each individual ingroup member as sacrosanct, they see the lives of ingroup members as adding incrementally to the value of the group as a whole. For this reason, when it comes to sacrificing their lives for ingroup members, weakly fused persons may be sensitive to utilitarian principles: the more lives at stake, the more inclined they should be to sacrifice their own life. We tested this hypothesis in Experiment 7.</p><a id="psp-106-5-713-EHDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_29" title="Experiment 1: Moral Perceptions of Self-Sacrifice">Experiment 1: Moral Perceptions of Self-Sacrifice</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The goal of this Experiment was to assess perceptions of the morality of each of the two response options to our intragroup versions of the trolley dilemma.

Indeed, recent research shows that when people consider committing harm against others, they normatively rely upon a proscriptive morality that is strict and obligation-based (i.e., to not do harm; 
          Janoff-Bulman, Sheikh, &amp; Hepp, 2009). One implication of these different perceptions of the dilemmas is that participants may be more inclined to endorse self-sacrifice in the “luring” than in the “summoning” dilemma. We tested this possibility in Experiment 2.

In adopting this “think aloud” paradigm, we acknowledge that self-reports have a somewhat checkered history within psychology, in general, and social psychology, in particular (
        Nisbett &amp; Wilson, 1977). Nevertheless, the most telling critiques of this approach have focused on 
        <em>retrospective</em> self-reports. These critiques are justified because when people look back upon their behaviors, a great deal of information is either completely lost or systematically degraded by numerous sources of bias. Nevertheless, this problem is vastly diminished when participants report on their thoughts 
        <em>concurrently</em>, that is, 
        <em>while</em> they make decisions (
        Ericsson &amp; Simon, 1993). We accordingly examined participants’ concurrent verbal protocols as they decided how to respond to the dilemma.

Mindful of the fact that self-sacrifice was considerably more common among strongly fused participants, we examined the rationales participants offered as they endorsed self-sacrifice. Strongly fused endorsers of self-sacrifice responded with rationales that emphasized group-related emotions, explaining that it was upsetting to them that their group members were in such a predicament. Many also noted an immediate impulse to forfeit their life to save the lives of the ingroup members. In contrast, among the few weakly fused participants who endorsed self-sacrifice, the decision emerged more slowly and was marked by utilitarian rationales—“Self-sacrifice is called for because the lives of five people are more valuable than the life of one.” Tellingly, their reasoning was devoid of any reference to attachment to the group members. Instead, their reasoning focused on minimizing the number of lives lost.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Strongly and weakly fused participants also differed in the rationales they offered for 
          <em>failing</em> to endorse self-sacrifice. The mental gymnastics of strongly fused participants were especially intriguing. Even as they decided to consign the ingroup members to their deaths by refusing to endorse self-sacrifice, strongly fused participants denied that they were forsaking their ingroup members. Instead, they insisted that “there must be a different option!” or “the group members must be saved!” In contrast, when weakly fused persons endorsed letting ingroup members perish, they insisted that they were, quite understandably, following their gut survival instincts. They attempted to excuse their decision to prioritize their own survival over that of group members by attempting to distance themselves psychologically from the victims.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">One way of contrasting the responses of strongly and weakly fused participants is in terms of the content of their deontological and utilitarian impulses. For strongly fused persons, their deontological impulse was shaped by emotional distress associated with the possibility that several group members might die. This impulse often led them to endorse self-sacrifice. When it did not, their most common follow-up response was to deny the reality of the dilemma they confronted.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">For weakly fused persons, their deontological impulse was shaped by their survival instinct, an impulse that encouraged them to endorse self-preservation. When they resisted this impulse, their follow-up response was to engage in utilitarian reasoning, a process that led a limited number of weakly fused persons to endorse self-sacrifice.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">If our participants were indeed motivated by quick, affect-laden, deontological impulses to either ensure the survival of their group members (strongly fused) or ensure their own survival (weakly fused), then manipulations that are designed to amplify deontological impulses should exaggerate the characteristic responses of participants. To test this possibility, in Experiment 5 we hurried participants’ responses, a technique that research on moral decision making has shown to amplify deontological responding (
          Suter &amp; Hertwig, 2011).

In contrast, weakly fused participants were especially inclined to endorse self-sacrifice after their social selves were activated but not after their personal selves were activated. This pattern of results also supports our assumption that strongly fused persons experience close relational ties with fellow group members. That is, insofar as fused individuals develop strong, family like ties between themselves and other group members, it is not surprising that activating their personal selves augmented their desire to protect the individuals with whom they were so strongly aligned.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The strong relational, family like ties that fused persons presumably develop toward other ingroup members have a further implication. To the extent that people experience a sense of oneness with the group, they may be just as inclined to sacrifice their lives for a single member of the ingroup as for multiple members of the ingroup. After all, if the death of a “family” member is equivalent to my own death, then the death of five family members is likewise my own death. In contrast, weakly fused persons may take a more emotionally detached, analytic view of the value of the lives of ingroup members. Rather than seeing the lives of individual ingroup members as equivalent to their own death, they see the lives of each ingroup member as adding incrementally to the group category. For this reason, when it comes to sacrificing their lives for ingroup members, weakly fused persons may be sensitive to utilitarian principles: The more lives that are in danger, the more inclined they should be to sacrifice their own life. We tested this hypothesis in Experiment 7.</p><a id="psp-106-5-713-EBDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_146" title="Experiment 7: For Whom Is Self-Sacrifice Utilitarian?">Experiment 7: For Whom Is Self-Sacrifice Utilitarian?</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><a id="psp-106-5-713-ECBDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Participants were 1,368 Spanish undergraduates at UNED (757 women;

Such individuals therefore appeared to follow deontological principles (e.g., “do no harm to any group member”), in that the life of even a single ingroup member was sufficient to justify sacrificing one’s own life. In contrast, weakly fused participants appeared to follow utilitarian principles when deciding to sacrifice themselves for the group, expressing more willingness to self-sacrifice for five than for one ingroup member.</p><a id="psp-106-5-713-EADA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_158" title="General Discussion">General Discussion</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Although many ridiculed Fan Meizhong for leaving his students in the lurch when an earthquake struck, our findings suggest that Fan is not alone in his unwillingness to risk his life to save others. Our participants responded to a pair of intragroup moral dilemmas in which it was apparent to most people that the morally correct response was to sacrifice one’s life to save several people. Nevertheless, about half of our participants endorsed saving their own life over the morally correct response, even when saving themselves came at the expense of the lives of five innocents. Hence, although nearly all of our participants 
        <em>knew</em> what was right, only those who were strongly fused endorsed translating their moral knowledge into 
        <em>doing</em> what was right. This raises an intriguing question: What were our participants thinking and feeling? More specifically, what were the cognitive and emotional processes responsible for the moral resolve of fused individuals?
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We began with the assumption that the state of fusion is distinguished by a feeling of oneness with the group and the formation of close, family-like, relational ties to other group members. The responses of our participants to the dilemmas confirmed this conceptualization. For example, although strongly fused persons were just as concerned with self-preservation as their weakly fused counterparts, strongly fused persons were unique in their devotion to saving members of their group. Further, when strongly fused persons learned that members of their group were imperiled, they reported experiencing emotions similar to what they would experience were they themselves imperiled. These emotional reactions, in turn, mediated the effects of fusion on the endorsement of sacrificing oneself for the ingroup.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Among weakly fused participants, the (less frequently traveled) pathway to self-sacrifice was quite different. Lacking strong relational ties toward their compatriots, when they pondered sacrificing themselves, weakly fused participants initially expressed concerns with their own survival and spoke of their threatened ingroup members in distant, unemotional terms. Later, they shifted to a consideration of utilitarian considerations, such as the number of potential victims who would die in the dilemma. As a result, they were more apt to endorse self-sacrifice for five victims compared to one.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Strength of identity fusion was also related to the reasons for 
        <em>refraining from</em> self-sacrifice. When strongly fused participants declined to endorse self-sacrifice, they denied that they were forsaking the ingroup, clinging instead to the illusory idea that there must be a way to save both the ingroup members and themselves. In contrast, weakly fused participants distanced themselves from the group members and focused on themselves. They insisted that their refusal to endorse self-sacrifice was only natural given their possession of a quintessentially human survival motive.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We expected that one of the clearest differences between fused and non-fused participants would be their deontological impulses. On the one hand, we anticipated that upon learning that members of their group were in jeopardy, strongly fused persons would mentally transport themselves into the situation facing their compatriots and experience the group members’ emotions as their own. On the other hand, we expected that the threat that the dilemma posed to their personal survival would dominate the immediate reactions of weakly fused persons. For these reasons, we predicted that requiring participants to hurry their response to the dilemma would amplify the divergent deontological impulses of strongly and weakly fused participants. Our results supported this prediction. When we placed participants under time pressure by requiring that they respond to the dilemma quickly, strongly fused participants were especially inclined to endorse self-sacrifice, and weakly fused participants were especially 
        <em>dis</em>inclined to endorse self-sacrifice. This suggests that when people feel compelled to act quickly because they are under threat they may be especially likely to translate their feelings of fusion with the group into extreme pro-group behavior.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">This difference in the deontological impulses of strongly and weakly fused persons to the dilemmas implies that activating the source of such impulses—their personal selves—should have very different consequences. To test this prediction, we primed the social and personal selves of participants. Not surprisingly, priming their social selves increased endorsement of self-sacrifice among both strongly and weakly fused participants. More interestingly, priming the personal self increased endorsement of self-sacrifice among strongly fused participants but further reduced endorsement of self-sacrifice among weakly fused participants.
        <a id="b-fn6"> </a><sup /> This evidence that activating the personal selves of strongly fused persons functioned in the same way as activating their social selves provides further evidence of the visceral sense of oneness that strongly fused participants experience with the group.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In summary, in the experiments reported here, we attempted to illuminate directly the nature of the emotional and cognitive processes that cause strongly fused persons to embrace self-sacrifice for the group and weakly fused persons to embrace their own survival. Our findings indicated that strongly and weakly fused persons differed not only in how often they endorsed self-sacrifice to save others, but in the psychological pathway they followed to this destination. When they recognized that their group members were in danger, strongly fused persons immediately felt as if they themselves were in danger and it did not matter whether one or several ingroup members were threatened. At the same time, weakly fused persons focused on their own survival and endorsed the sacrifice of group members. On those relatively rare occasions that weakly fused people winded up endorsing self-sacrifice, they were inspired to do so by a cool calculus that focused on utilitarian concerns such as the impact of their decision on the number of people who would live or die.</p><a id="psp-106-5-713-EBADA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Links to Recent Work on Moral Reasoning</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Over the last two decades, theorists and researchers have increasingly acknowledged dual process models in which controlled and automatic processes play complementary roles in moral decision making (e.g., 
          Greene et al., 2008; 
          Lombrozo, 2009). Our findings revealed instances of both automatic and controlled processing in the moral decision making of our participants. For example, the relatively automatic, deontological response of strongly fused participants was to save the lives of group members who were imperiled. In contrast, the relatively automatic, deontological response of weakly fused participants was to save themselves.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Additional reflection took strongly and weakly fused participants in very different directions. On the path to deciding to save themselves at the expense of the group, strongly fused participants struggled (without success) to develop a rationale that would allow them to simultaneously save both themselves and the group. On the path to deciding to save the group, weakly fused participants noted that sacrificing themselves would result in fewer people dying than allowing five ingroup members to perish. Apparently, strongly versus weakly fused persons diverged in both their spontaneous and reasoned reactions to the dilemmas.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Our evidence of the impact of the immediate, emotional responses of fused persons on their moral decision making has some parallels in the recent literature on sacred values and culture of honor. In studies of extremists in the Middle East, for example, researchers have used the label “devoted actors” to refer to individuals whose decisions are determined by “sacred values” that turn on a rule-bound, emotionally arousing moral logic (
          Sheikh, Ginges, Coman, &amp; Atran, 2012). The rationales underlying the pro-group behavior of these devoted actors are irrational in that they are insensitive to quantity and abhor material tradeoffs (
          Atran &amp; Ginges, 2012; 
          Ginges, Atran, Medin, &amp; Shikaki, 2007; 
          Ginges, Atran, Sachdeva, &amp; Medin, 2011; see also 
          Skitka, 2002, 
          2010, for parallel findings with regard to “moral convictions”). Similarly, individuals who adhere to the principles of culture of honor react to perceived slights to in-group members with “illogical” levels of retribution that far exceed what could be justified from an objective standpoint (e.g., 
          Cohen &amp; Nisbett, 1994; 
          Cohen, Nisbett, Bowdle, &amp; Schwarz, 1996). Our data suggest that identify fusion may play a role in the emotional responses of such individuals. Witness, for example, that fused persons became highly emotional when they learned of the plight of members of their group. Moreover, the deontological impulses of strongly fused persons rendered them uniquely insensitive to the number of potential victims of the runaway trolley in Experiment 7.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Such tantalizing links between our research and recent work on moral decision making notwithstanding, one limitation of our work is the use of hypothetical dilemmas (for a review of research on identity fusion that employs alternative methodologies, see 
          Swann et al., 2012). It is reassuring that recent work has demonstrated links between responses to moral dilemmas and theoretically relevant variables such as empathic concern, religiosity, perspective taking and moral identity (
          Conway &amp; Gawronski, 2013; see also 
          Bartels, 2008; 
          Schnall, Haidt, Clore, &amp; Jordon, 2008). Nevertheless, future work is needed to better understand relationships between 
          <em>in situ</em> moral reasoning about self-sacrifice and actual engagement in self-sacrificial behavior. An interesting step along these lines includes interviews of terrorists that have highlighted the close associations between steadfast group commitment, moral justifications, and follow-through of extremist attacks (
          Atran, 2010; 
          Stern, 2003). Much remains to be done, however.

Yet, when asked what they would actually do if confronted with this dilemma, many people said that they would selfishly opt to save themselves. In fact, even when the only way to save their own life was to lure five unsuspecting compatriots into a deathtrap, roughly half of our participants endorsed this morally bankrupt option. Not so for people who felt strongly fused to their group. The willingness of strongly fused persons to sacrifice themselves to save members of their group appear to be mediated by the immediate, emotional reactions that they experienced when they imagined that their group members were in danger. For strongly fused persons, it was almost as if they themselves, or a family member, were in danger. These emotional reactions caused them to do what most people naively believe they would do: endorse translating a sense of what they morally 
          <em>should</em> do into a decision about what they 
          <em>would</em> do.

          Swann et al., 2012), identification effects were always weaker than fusion effects and never qualified the effects of fusion. We accordingly deleted identification from the primary analyses.

As expected, fusion with Spain had no impact on endorsement of self-sacrifice in either dilemma. This result replicates previous evidence that fusion with Spain had no influence on willingness to sacrifice the self for members of other countries (
          Swann, Gómez, Dovidio, et al., 2010). In addition, fusion was unrelated to perceptions of morality in both dilemmas. Consistent with Experiment 2, the only significant predictor of morality perceptions was one’s response to the dilemma. Details of this experiment are available from the first author.

Unlike the earlier experiment, in this dilemma the personal self was activated by informing participants that they were going to be crushed by the train before referencing the group members. This may have reinforced the impact of the personal-self-activation manipulation. In the earlier experiment, the group members were referenced first, which may have muted the effect of activating the personal self.
