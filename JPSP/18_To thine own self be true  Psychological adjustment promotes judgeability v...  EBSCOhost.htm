The mechanisms behind this effect, however, are not well understood. How does adjustment facilitate judgeability? In the present video-perceptions study, we examined potential mechanisms through which adjustment could promote judgeability at 3 stages of the Realistic Accuracy Model (RAM; Funder, 1995): (a) cue relevance, (b) cue availability, and (c) cue detection. We found that well-adjusted individuals were more judgeable because they provided more relevant cues: Specifically, well-adjusted individuals behaved more in line with their distinctive personalities, which in turn led them to be seen more accurately. In contrast, neither cue availability nor detection could sufficiently account for the link between adjustment and judgeability. In sum, well-adjusted individuals are more judgeable because to their own selves, they are true.

        Colvin, 1993a, 
        1993b) and new acquaintances (
        Human &amp; Biesanz, 2011a). But why are well-adjusted individuals such open books? Perhaps they are higher quality, more informative books, providing others with better information. Or it may be that they are longer books, providing others with more information. Finally, they might more interesting, attention-getting books, prompting others to pick up more of the information they provide. Given the potential benefits of being perceived accurately (e.g., 
        Human, Sandstrom, Biesanz, &amp; Dunn, 2013; 
        Lackenbauer, Campbell, Rubin, Fletcher, &amp; Troister, 2010; 
        Swann, De La Ronde, &amp; Hixon, 1994), it is important to better understand the mechanisms through which target adjustment promotes accuracy. We examined several potential mechanisms using a video perception first impressions paradigm.

        Colvin, 1993a, 
        1993b) or good targets (
        Funder, 1995). Judgeability is a temporally stable individual difference with demonstrated convergent validity among multiple indices of judgeability (
        Colvin, 1993a, 
        1993b). Judgeability requires some degree of expressive accuracy (
        Human &amp; Biesanz, 2011a), the ability to accurately express oneself to others. In particular, in the present studies, we investigated 
        <em>distinctive</em> expressive accuracy: the extent to which targets’ unique, differentiating characteristics were accurately understood (
        Cronbach, 1955; 
        Furr, 2008; 
        Human &amp; Biesanz, 2011a). That is, if Jane is able to tell that Joe is more reliable than talkative, and more reliable than other specific targets and the average person, Joe is being seen with distinctive accuracy. If most people are able to understand Joe’s distinctive personality profile, he is high in distinctive expressive accuracy, or a judgeable person. In the current study, we measured distinctive accuracy by comparing perceivers’ impressions to self- and close-other (parents and friends) reports of the targets’ personalities.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Distinctive expressive accuracy controls for normative expressive accuracy, which refers to being seen as similar to the average person (
        Cronbach, 1955; 
        Furr, 2008).
        <a id="b-fn1"> </a><sup /> Given that the normative personality profile is very positive on average (
        Borkenau &amp; Zaltauskas, 2009; 
        Edwards, 1957), being seen with normative accuracy also implies being seen positively. As well-adjusted individuals do tend to be more normative (
        D. Wood, Gosling, &amp; Potter, 2007) and possess more positive personality traits (
        Emmons &amp; Diener, 1985), it is important to disentangle whether well-adjusted individuals’ expressive accuracy is derived from distinctive or normative expressive accuracy. Of note, previous work suggests that well-adjusted individuals’ expressive accuracy is primarily a result of distinctive accuracy (
        Colvin, 1993b; 
        Human &amp; Biesanz, 2011a), making distinctive expressive accuracy the primary focus of the current study. Thus, throughout the article we use the general terms expressive accuracy and judgeability interchangeably with the more precise term distinctive expressive accuracy and will explicitly note when we are discussing normative expressive accuracy.

          Funder, 1995, 
          1999), which outlines the stages that need to be met for accurate impressions to be achieved. Namely, (a) 
          <em>relevant</em> cues must be made (b) 
          <em>available</em> to perceivers, who must then (c) 
          <em>detect</em> and (d) appropriately 
          <em>utilize</em> these cues. The first two stages are primarily in the control of target, whereas the latter two stages are more the responsibility of the perceiver. Nevertheless, it is possible that the target could influence the latter two stages by influencing perceiver behavior, such as their attention and motivation, for example. As such, assuming the provision of at least some relevant information, judgeable people can be defined as those who facilitate one or more of the stages of RAM, thereby promoting the accuracy of impressions formed about them.
        </p><a id="psp-106-2-286-EADDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The Importance of Expressive Accuracy</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">There are large individual differences in distinctive expressive accuracy (
          Biesanz, 2010; 
          Human &amp; Biesanz, 2013) and such differences in turn have a strong impact on the accuracy of impressions (
          Gesn &amp; Ickes, 1999; 
          Marangoni, Garcia, Ickes, &amp; Teng, 1995; 
          Snodgrass, Hecht, &amp; Ploutz-Snyder, 1998; 
          Thomas &amp; Maio, 2008; 
          Zaki, Bolger, &amp; Ochsner, 2008; but see 
          Thomas &amp; Fletcher, 2003). In contrast, there are much fewer individual differences in perceptive accuracy, the ability to accurately understand others’ personalities (
          Biesanz, 2010; 
          Human &amp; Biesanz, 2011b, 
          2013). Thus, the target plays an important role in influencing the ultimate accuracy of impressions, perhaps even more so than the perceiver (
          Human &amp; Biesanz, 2013; 
          Kenny, 1994). Yet little is known about what factors promote expressive accuracy, and less still about the underlying mechanisms linking target characteristics to expressive accuracy.
        </p><a id="psp-106-2-286-ECDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_14" title="Judgeability and Psychological Adjustment">Judgeability and Psychological Adjustment</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">One characteristic that has been consistently linked to judgeability is psychological adjustment, defined broadly as encompassing both hedonic well-being (e.g., happiness, a positive appraisal of one’s life; 
        Kahneman, Diener, &amp; Schwartz, 1999) and eudaimonic well-being (e.g., a purposeful life and satisfying relationships; 
        Keyes, Schmotkin, &amp; Ryff, 2002; 
        Ryan &amp; Deci, 2001; 
        Waterman, 1993). Well-adjusted individuals tend to be seen more accurately by close peers (
        Colvin, 1993a, 
        1993b) and by new acquaintances in face-to-face impressions (
        Human &amp; Biesanz, 2011a). Further, adolescent psychological adjustment is a precursor to judgeability in young adulthood, suggesting that adjustment may play a causal role in promoting judgeability (
        Colvin, 1993a). Importantly, well-adjusted individuals do not appear to be more judgeable simply because they have greater self-knowledge, which could inflate self–other agreement (
        Human &amp; Biesanz, 2011a). There is also less direct evidence that adjustment is associated with greater judgeability in zero-acquaintance situations (
        Ambady, Hallahan, &amp; Rosenthal, 1995) and in nonverbal sending paradigms (
        Friedman, Riggio, &amp; Casella, 1988; 
        Larrance &amp; Zuckerman, 1981; 
        H. R. Riggio &amp; Riggio, 2002; 
        R. E. Riggio &amp; Friedman, 1986). Thus, psychological adjustment appears to be a robust and consistent predictor of judgeability across different relationship contexts and impression domains.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Despite strong evidence that psychological adjustment is associated with greater judgeability, little is known about 
        <em>why</em> psychological adjustment would promote judgeability. Drawing on the first three stages of the realistic accuracy model, the current study examined how target adjustment may facilitate judgeability via cue relevance, availability, and detection (see 
        Figure 1 for an overview).

            Sherman, Nave, &amp; Funder, 2012). Personality–behavior congruence likely derives from more general personality coherence, the extent to which one’s personality follows a lawful organization or patterning within an individual (
            Allport, 1937; 
            Cervone &amp; Shoda, 1999). Various indicators of personality coherence, such as cross-situational consistency and temporal stability, have been linked to greater self-close other agreement (
            Baird, Le, &amp; Lucas, 2006; 
            Bem &amp; Allen, 1974; 
            Biesanz &amp; West, 2000;

            Zuckerman, Bernieri, Koestner, &amp; Rosenthal, 1989; 
            Zuckerman et al., 1988; but see 
            Chaplin &amp; Goldberg, 1984; 
            Paunonen &amp; Jackson, 1985). However, no work appears to have examined whether personality coherence promotes judgeability in first impressions as well, nor has previous research examined the role of personality–behavior congruence specifically in judgeability.
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Do well-adjusted individuals exhibit greater personality–behavior congruence? Having a coherent, well-integrated sense of self has long been considered a hallmark of being a mature and well-adjusted individual (
            Block, 1961; 
            C. R. Rogers, 1961), and there is empirical evidence that psychological adjustment is associated with a variety of indicators of personality coherence (
            Block, 1961; 
            Campbell, 1990; 
            Clifton &amp; Kuper, 2011; 
            Diehl &amp; Hay, 2007, 
            2010; 
            Donahue, Robins, Roberts, &amp; John, 1993; 
            Erickson, Newman, &amp; Pincus, 2009; 
            Human, Biesanz, et al., 2013; 
            McReynolds, Altrocchi, &amp; House, 2000; 
            Sheldon, Ryan, Rawsthorne, &amp; Ilardi, 1997; 
            Suh, 2002; but see 
            Baird, Le, &amp; Lucas, 2006), including personality–behavior congruence (
            Sherman, Nave, &amp; Funder, 2010, 
            2012). However, recent work has found that although well-adjusted individuals tend to behave more in line with their personalities in different social situations, they do not necessarily behave more in line with their distinctive personality traits; instead, they are more likely to behave in line with the more normative personality profile (
            Sherman et al., 2012). People also tend to feel more authentic when they behave more in line with the normative (and positive) personality profile, than with their own distinctive traits (
            Fleeson &amp; Wilt, 2010). Thus, it remains unclear whether well-adjusted individuals do indeed exhibit greater distinctive personality–behavior congruence and, if so, whether this form of personality coherence is in turn responsible for their greater distinctive expressive accuracy in first impressions.
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Internally relevant information</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Well-adjusted individuals may also provide more relevant information by providing higher quality verbal information that is more revealing of their personalities. Indeed, some types of information are more diagnostic of one’s personality (
            Letzring, Wells, &amp; Funder, 2006), such as discussing one’s thoughts and feelings rather than behaviors and actions (
            Andersen, 1984). Providing such information likely aids in the ability to form impressions about less observable traits (e.g., anxiety, thoughtfulness), which are typically more difficult to judge than more readily observable personality traits (e.g., talkativeness, intelligence; 
            Funder &amp; Dobroth, 1987; 
            John &amp; Robins, 1993; 
            Kenrick &amp; Stringfield, 1980).
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Are well-adjusted individuals more likely to express their internal thoughts and feelings? There is some preliminary evidence that this may be the case. Disclosure or expression of emotional or distressing experiences is related to better psychological and physical health (
            Pennebaker, 1997; 
            Smyth, 1998). In particular, the use of more positive and negative emotion words and cognitive processing words, such as causal (because, reason) and insight (understand, realize) words, are associated with improving physical health (
            Pennebaker, Mayne, &amp; Francis, 1997). It is possible that such emotion expression and cognitive processing not only promotes psychological and physical health but that well-adjusted individuals are also more likely to use such words and more generally discuss their thoughts and feelings in their daily lives. If so, well-adjusted individuals would likely be providing others with more relevant cues, enabling more accurate perceptions of their personalities.
          </p><a id="psp-106-2-286-ECCDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Cue Availability</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Information quantity</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Target psychological adjustment may also promote expressive accuracy by enhancing the overall availability of cues. Psychological adjustment, particularly the positive affect component, is associated with greater extraversion (
            Lucas, Diener, Grob, Suh, &amp; Shao, 2000). In turn, extraversion and greater social ease could lead well-adjusted individuals to provide others with more information (e.g., 
            Letzring, 2008). In turn, greater information quantity enhances accuracy (
            Biesanz, West, &amp; Millevoi, 2007; 
            Blackman &amp; Funder, 1998). Thus, well-adjusted individuals may provide perceivers with a greater quantity of information upon which to base their impressions, thereby enhancing accuracy.
          </p><a id="psp-106-2-286-EBCDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Cue Detection</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Perceiver attention</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Well-adjusted individuals may also facilitate perceivers’ cue detection and perhaps even utilization. Specifically, the social skills and likability of well-adjusted individuals may garner more attention from perceivers and motivate them to better understand such targets. Indeed, individuals who report more meaning in life, one indicator of psychological adjustment, are rated as more interpersonally appealing (
            Stillman, Lambert, Fincham, &amp; Baumeister, 2011), which is likely to elicit more attention from others. Further, the more confident, positive, and involved behaviors of positive self-presenters (
            Human, Biesanz, Parisotto, &amp; Dunn, 2012) are associated with receiving more attention; perhaps well-adjusted individuals are likely to behave in a similarly positive manner, thus also receiving greater attention. In turn, greater perceiver attention (
            Human et al., 2012; 
            Lorenzo, Biesanz, &amp; Human, 2010) and motivation (
            Biesanz &amp; Human, 2010) result in more accurate impressions.
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">On the other hand, there is also evidence that negative characteristics can elicit more attention from others. In line with the “bad is stronger than good” argument (
            Baumeister, Bratslavsky, Fikenauer, &amp; Vohs, 2001), negative information tends to be more salient and thereby receive more attention and processing than positive information (
            Skowronski &amp; Carlston, 1989). Thus, to the extent that mal-adjusted individuals provide more negative information in social interactions than well-adjusted individuals, they may in fact receive more attention and processing, which could in turn facilitate accurate impressions. As a result, it is unclear what role perceiver attention, and thereby cue detection and possibly utilization, play in the links between psychological adjustment and expressive accuracy.

That is, well-adjusted individuals may enhance accuracy (a) by providing others with more relevant cues, via greater personality–behavior congruence or by providing more internally relevant information, (b) by making more information available to others, such as by speaking more, and/or (c) by eliciting greater cue detection by being more attention-getting and engaging (see 
          Figure 1). In a video perceptions study, utilizing two different samples of targets, we first examined whether well-adjusted individuals are perceived more accurately in this first impressions context, and then examined the role of each of these proposed mechanisms in linking psychological adjustment and distinctive expressive accuracy.

In both samples, targets were filmed while answering personal questions and then asked whether they would consent to having their video shown to future participants in personality assessment studies. Targets were given the option to have their video deleted without compensation loss. Three targets in Sample 1 and 13 targets in Sample 2 did not consent and had their video immediately deleted, resulting in 116 targets (89 female, 27 male; 
            <em>M</em>age = 22 years, 
            <em>SD</em> = 5.04). The majority of targets reported being of primarily East Asian descent (53%) or European American descent (31%), with the remaining 14% reporting one of several other ethnic backgrounds (e.g., Middle Eastern, South American). Two targets did not report their ethnicity. The samples did not differ significantly from one another in age, gender, ethnic breakdown, or psychological adjustment (all 
            <em>p</em>s &gt; .15). The two samples followed very similar procedures and the general pattern of results was highly consistent within each sample; sample specific procedures and notable differences in the pattern of results are noted below, where applicable.

The interview began with a brief informal warm-up conversation that was not shown to perceivers. Targets were then asked to read a series of newspaper headlines from the 
              <em>New York Times</em> aloud to the camera, which were shown to perceivers, as this task is diagnostic of personality in first impression contexts (
              Borkenau, Mauer, Riemann, Spinath, &amp; Angleitner, 2004). Targets then engaged in a more structured interview session, answering a series of personal questions. Due to time constraints, two questions that were adapted from previous first impressions research (
              Andersen, 1984) were selected to be shown to perceivers: “Discuss some major decisions or choices you have faced in your life,” and “Describe any major conflicts you have dealt with.” Targets were aware that the videos were being collected for the purpose of showing future participants and received $30 for their participation.

              Andersen, 1984) and on questions that appear on online dating websites (e.g., Match.com), in an effort to map on to a real-world getting acquainted scenario. Two questions derived from online dating sites were selected to be shown to perceivers: “List two or three interests,” and “What are you passionate about?” While being videotaped, targets were unaware that their videos would be used as stimuli in future studies. All targets received either $10 or one extra course credit for their participation.

We also added three items assessing perceived intelligence (“Is bright,” “Is intelligent,” “Receives good grades”), in order to further capture the intellect component of openness to experience. Targets were also asked to provide the contact information of two peers and a parent or guardian so that we could obtain personality assessments of the participants by close informants. All informants were mailed or e-mailed the same personality questionnaire as completed by participants. At least one informant report was available for 97 targets (84%). All available informant reports were combined with the targets’ own self-reports to serve as a composite accuracy validation measure.

              <em>SD</em> = 9.34). In line with recent findings that the different components of well-being (e.g., hedonic and eudaimonic) tend to be indistinguishable in empirical research (
              Kashdan, Biswas-Diener, &amp; King, 2008; 
              Nave, Sherman, &amp; Funder, 2008) and that they show highly consistent associations with expressive accuracy (
              Human &amp; Biesanz, 2011a), we examined a standardized composite adjustment measure (α = .86) for ease of presentation. In general, the results with each individual component of well-being were very consistent with the composite, although notable exceptions will be discussed below.

            <em>n</em>targets per perceiver = 18). A randomization procedure, whereby each target appeared in two different sets of videos, ensured that each target was viewed by two groups of participants; each target was therefore viewed by 22–36 perceivers.

Behavior coders rated a different segment of the longer videotaped interviews than perceivers who rated personality, in order to help distinguish personality perceptions from behavior perceptions. Specifically, coders in Sample 1 viewed the targets answering two other questions adapted from 
                Andersen (1984): “Could you tell me a little more about the important relationships (e.g., family, friends, romantic partner) in your life?” and “What major event(s) do you feel have shaped you as a person?” Coders in Sample 2 viewed the targets answering the questions “What are the three things for which you are the most thankful for and why?” (adapted from online dating websites) and “Discuss some major decisions or choices you have faced in your life” (adapted from 
                Andersen, 1984). One target in Sample 2 did not answer these two questions prior to the 5-min time limit and was therefore not included in the personality–behavior congruence analyses.
              </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Coders rated behaviors on a 24-item behavioral questionnaire designed to map on to the 24-item version of the BFI that perceivers used for personality ratings. The behavioral questionnaire was modeled after the Riverside Behavioral Q-Sort (RBQ; 
                Funder, Furr, &amp; Colvin, 2000), which was designed for coding global behaviors rather than molecular behaviors during dyadic interactions. For example, we matched the following BFI items with the corresponding behavioral items: “Is full of energy” with “Was energetic during the interview”; “Tends to find fault with others” with “Discussed others’ faults and shortcomings” (see 
                Appendix A for the full list of behavior items). All ratings were made on a 1 (
                <em>not at all or negatively characteristic</em>) to 7 (
                <em>highly characteristic</em>) scale.
              </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">When rating behaviors, coders were explicitly told:

                
<blockquote>We are trying to characterize fairly directly the behavior that can be seen on the videotape. So, as much as possible, avoid drawing inferences about the characteristics or intentions of the subjects that are not directly visible. Direct statements of feelings such as forgiveness, anxiety, or confidence should be taken at face value, and such feelings should not be inferred in the absence of direct statements or other visible evidence.</blockquote>
Coders’ ratings of targets’ behaviors were averaged to index each target’s behavior on each of the 24 items. We assessed targets’ personality–behavior congruence by examining the extent to which targets’ personalities (as reported by the self and, where possible, informant reports) predicted their behaviors, as rated by coders.

                <em>M</em> = 4.67, 
                <em>SD</em> = 1.09). In Sample 1, a separate set of 52 coders made these ratings after viewing the same segment of the videos that perceivers who rated personality viewed. In Sample 2, the perceivers who made the personality ratings also made the thoughts and feelings ratings. For both samples, we computed each target’s average thoughts and feelings rating across all of the coders or perceivers who rated this characteristic.
              </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">To supplement the more subjective thoughts and behaviors ratings, we also assessed the provision of internally relevant information with concrete word counts using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count program (LIWC; 
                Pennebaker, Booth, &amp; Francis, 2007). Specifically, LIWC coded for the percentage of positive (
                <em>M</em> = 7.78, 
                <em>SD</em> = 4.31) and negative 
                <em>SD</em> = 0.64,

                <em>M</em> = 1.59, 
                <em>SD</em> = 1.12) and insight words (e.g., think, know; 
                <em>M</em> = 2.51, 
                <em>SD</em> = 1.95), as indicators of discussion of thoughts. Global ratings of the extent to which targets discussed their thoughts and feelings were significantly correlated with speaking more negative emotion words (
                <em>r</em> = .28), insight words (
                <em>r</em> = .23), and causal words (

To examine whether target adjustment was associated with being more attention getting, we averaged all available perceiver ratings of how attention-getting each target was (i.e., assessing target main effects). However, when examining the extent to which perceiver attention was associated with distinctive accuracy in the multilevel model framework, we subtracted perceiver and target main effects from the raw ratings, creating a unique dyadic indicator of attention that varied across perceivers and targets.

              Figure 2A). Indeed, paying more attention to a less adjusted target was not significantly associated with greater accuracy. Thus, the benefits to accuracy that come from paying more attention to a target are greater for well-adjusted relative to less adjusted targets.

Thus, perceiver attention is related to greater detection of behavioral information, helping to elucidate the nature of the interaction between adjustment and attention predicting greater distinctive accuracy: Because well-adjusted individuals provide more relevant behavioral cues, paying more attention to them enhances distinctive accuracy by enhancing the extent to which the perceiver then detects those behavioral cues. The fact that dyadic perceiver attention does not enhance distinctive accuracy for less adjusted targets nicely illustrates the multiplicative nature of the realistic accuracy model (
                Funder, 1995): paying more attention to targets, and thereby enhancing cue detection and potentially utilization, is only beneficial to the extent that the previous stages of RAM, cue relevance and availability, are met. Because less adjusted individuals provide less relevant cues, paying more attention to them is not as beneficial for distinctive accuracy.

This replicates and extends previous research that has found that well-adjusted individuals are seen more accurately by close others (
        Colvin, 1993a, 
        1993b) and new acquaintances in face-to-face interactions (
        Human &amp; Biesanz, 2011a). Thus, well-adjusted individuals are easier to understand even when perceivers do not interact with them directly.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">More important, however, this study sheds light on why well-adjusted individuals are so easy to understand. Specifically, well-adjusted individuals tend to behave more in line with their distinctive personality traits than less adjusted individuals. In turn, perceivers heavily rely on the behavioral information that targets’ provide. As a result, well-adjusted individuals are seen much more in line with their distinctive personalities than less adjusted individuals. Thus, well-adjusted individuals are more judgeable because they facilitate the cue relevance stage of the realistic accuracy model (RAM; 
        Funder, 1995). Well-adjusted individuals’ judgeability is further amplified when perceivers pay attention to them, thereby facilitating the cue detection and utilization stages of RAM. Note that all of the primary effects held within each sample independently as well as combined, providing a nice internal replication of this pattern of results. These findings have implications not only for the role of psychological adjustment in impression formation but also for the nature of psychological adjustment and impression formation more generally.
      </p><a id="psp-106-2-286-EDADA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Mechanisms</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Personality-behavior congruence</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The finding that psychological adjustment is associated with greater personality–behavior congruence is in line with the long-standing idea that personality coherence is a critical feature of psychological adjustment and maturity (
            Block, 1961; 
            C. R. Rogers, 1961), and with much related empirical research (
            Clifton &amp; Kuper, 2011; 
            Diehl &amp; Hay, 2007, 
            2010; 
            Donahue et al., 1993; 
            Erickson et al., 2009; 
            McReynolds et al., 2000; 
            Sheldon et al., 1997; 
            Sherman et al., 2010; but see 
            Baird et al., 2006). However, this finding is less consistent with recent work finding that adjustment and authenticity are associated with behaving in a normative manner, rather than in line with one’s distinctive personality profile (
            Fleeson &amp; Wilt, 2010; 
            Sherman et al., 2012). In Sample 2, we found that well-adjusted individuals were more likely to behave in line with the normative profile, but in both samples well-adjusted individuals were also more likely to behave in line with their distinctive personality traits than less adjusted individuals. It is unclear why previous research has not found similar effects, but it may be due to methodological differences: Our study examined personality–behavior congruence in a getting-acquainted situation and assessed behavior with outside observers, whereas previous research has focused on behavior in daily life assessed by self-report (
            Fleeson &amp; Wilt, 2010; 
            Sherman et al., 2012). A critical avenue for future research will be to examine the associations between adjustment and distinctive versus normative personality–behavior congruence in different types of situations and with different behavior ratings methods.
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The fact that personality–behavior congruence was in turn linked to forming more accurate impressions is in line with previous research that has found other indices of personality coherence to be linked to more accurate impressions in close relationships (
            Baird et al., 2006; 
            Bem &amp; Allen, 1974; 
            Biesanz &amp; West, 2000; 
            Biesanz et al., 1998; 
            Cheek, 1982; 
            Kenrick &amp; Stringfield, 1980; 
            Zuckerman et al., 1989; 
            Zuckerman et al., 1988). However, to our knowledge, this is the first study to show that an indicator of personality coherence is associated with more accurate first impressions. This is interesting given that personality coherence, and the corresponding consistency and stability that go along with it, would seem most likely to promote accurate impressions where continued, long-term observation of behavior is possible (e.g., 
            Colvin, 1993b). These findings suggest, then, that personality coherence, when indexed as personality–behavior congruence, can result in immediate benefits to the accuracy of impressions.
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Furthermore, this is the first study to directly examine personality coherence as a mediating link between psychological adjustment and expressive accuracy. Although this is a correlational study, and therefore mediation cannot be definitively established, these results are consistent with the argument that greater psychological adjustment does indeed promote judgeability in first impressions via greater personality coherence, as indexed by personality–behavior congruence. It is likely, but remains to be empirically tested, that personality coherence also underlies the associations between psychological adjustment and greater judgeability in closer relationships.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">It is important to note, however, the conceptual and methodological challenges involved in assessing personality–behavior congruence. The present study had separate coders rate personality and behavior, and these different sets of coders rated different portions of the videos, in an effort to cleanly separate the assessment of these constructs. Nevertheless, it can still be argued that ratings of personality traits and molar ratings of behaviors based upon on the same social context may overlap too much to fully disentangle these constructs. Behavior ratings could be made more distinct from personality ratings perhaps by being more concrete and/or if based upon a different situation or set of situations. Yet each of these approaches present challenges. Highly concrete behavioral measures require substantial data collection and aggregation to achieve adequate reliability (
            Moskowitz &amp; Schwarz, 1982) for a single behavior, let alone a set of measures that capture a broad array of personality traits. Varying situational contexts for the assessments of personality and behavioral ratings introduces reliable variance associated with target culture that would attenuate observed relationships (
            English &amp; Chen, 2007, 
            2011). In sum, although the current study took steps to separate out personality and behavior ratings as cleanly as possible, developing better measures of personality–behavior congruence is another important aim for future research.
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Internally relevant information</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In line with previous research, the provision of more internally relevant information was also partially associated with greater accuracy (
            Andersen, 1984). Specifically, targets who discussed their thoughts and feelings to a greater extent and used more causal words were seen with marginally greater distinctive accuracy. However, well-adjusted individuals were not more likely to discuss their thoughts and feelings, and only the depression component of psychological adjustment was associated with the use of causal words. It remains possible that certain aspects of adjustment are associated with providing more internally relevant information, which in turn could contribute to well-adjusted individuals’ judgeability, but the evidence for this hypothesis in this study was quite weak. This possibility would perhaps be best followed up in more emotionally relevant contexts, where emotional and cognitive expression would be greater and, in turn, individual differences in emotional expression and coherence would be more likely to emerge.
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Information quantity</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In line with previous research (
            Biesanz et al., 2007; 
            Blackman &amp; Funder, 1998), several indicators of greater information quantity did promote distinctive accuracy in the current study. However, overall across samples, well-adjusted individuals did not tend to provide more information during the video clips. Thus, facilitating the cue availability stage of RAM does not appear to be well-adjusted individuals’ primary route to judgeabilty.
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Attention</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Paying more attention to targets was associated with forming more accurate impressions, in line with previous research (
            Human et al., 2012; 
            Lorenzo et al., 2010). However, on average across samples, well-adjusted individuals did not tend to receive more attention from others, thereby failing to support the idea that target psychological adjustment promotes the cue detection stage of RAM.
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Interestingly, examining the role of attention did further support the cue relevance explanation for well-adjusted individuals’ judgeability. Specifically, on average across samples and within each sample, there was a significant positive interaction between adjustment and attention predicting distinctive accuracy, such that paying more attention to targets enhanced accuracy more for well-adjusted than mal-adjusted targets. This finding indicates that well-adjusted individuals do provide others with more relevant information that, if detected, promotes more accurate impressions. In contrast, paying more attention to less adjusted individuals does not buy perceivers any additional accuracy, suggesting that less adjusted individuals do not emit as relevant cues. These findings are in line with the multiplicative nature of RAM (
            Funder, 1995), highlighting that facilitating the cue detection stage of RAM is only useful if the earlier stages of RAM, such as cue relevance, are met.
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Further, it appears that the more relevant information that highly attentive perceivers pick up is the greater personality–behavior congruence that well-adjusted targets exhibit. Indeed, we found that paying more attention to targets was associated with making greater use of their behavioral information when forming impressions. In turn, because well-adjusted individuals’ behavioral cues are more in line with their distinctive personalities, perceivers were then able to form more distinctively accurate impressions. In sum, although well-adjusted individuals do not appear to be more judgeable because they receive more attention, when they do receive more attention, their judgeability is further enhanced. Nevertheless, it is possible that perceivers are not fully aware of whom they are paying more attention to, making it important for future research to examine alternative indicators of attention, such as eye trackers or observer ratings.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Integration and implications</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Overall, the only consistent link between psychological adjustment and the proposed mechanisms underlying expressive accuracy was at the cue relevance stage of RAM, in the form of greater personality–behavior congruence. Note, however, that personality–behavior congruence did not fully account for the association between adjustment and expressive accuracy, indicating that future research should continue to examine the sources of well-adjusted individuals’ greater expressive accuracy. The role of internally relevant information was less consistent, but there were some hints that this type of cue relevance could also play a role, making this another interesting topic for further research. In contrast, the cue availability and detection phases did not have strong or consistent enough associations with psychological adjustment to lend much support to those potential mechanisms.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Overall, however, the general RAM model was supported, as greater cue relevance, availability, and detection were all associated with more accurate impressions to some degree. Thus, just because well-adjusted individuals appear to be seen more accurately primarily because of greater personality–behavior congruence, it is still possible for people to enhance their judgeability through other means. Assuming the provision of at least some relevant information, providing more of it or eliciting others’ attention are ways of enhancing one’s judgeability. Interestingly, eliciting others’ attention is not as hard as it may seem, as simply trying to make a good impression on others is one simple way to be seen as more engaging and in turn more accurately (
            Human et al., 2012). A fuller understanding of judgeability will require understanding what other characteristics of a target facilitate each of these stages of accurate impressions (see 
            Human &amp; Biesanz, 2013).
          </p><a id="psp-106-2-286-ECADA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Benefits of Judgeability</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">But why should people want to improve their judgeability? Being judgeable is now a well-established characteristic of psychologically adjusted individuals, but it is possible that judgeability also has benefits for psychological and interpersonal adjustment. For example, people strive to receive self-verifying information, or information that is in line with how one views the self (
          Swann &amp; Hill, 1982), and receiving such information is associated with greater intimacy in romantic relationships (
          Swann et al., 1994) and promotes relationship satisfaction (
          Lackenbauer et al., 2010). Assuming at least some degree of self-knowledge, judgeable individuals are therefore more likely to receive such information and in turn enjoy the corresponding benefits. Being seen accurately may also improve one’s sense of feeling understood, perhaps enhancing the perception of social support and reducing loneliness, which should both in turn promote individual and interpersonal functioning (e.g., 
          Cohen &amp; Willis, 1985; 
          Hawkley &amp; Cacioppo, 2010).
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Perceivers may also better like judgeable targets because they are likely to experience greater processing fluency and familiarity when forming impressions about judgeable targets, which tend to promote liking (e.g., 
          Langlois &amp; Roggman, 1990; 
          Reber, Schwarz, &amp; Winkielman, 2004; 
          Reis, Maniaci, Caprariello, Eastwick, &amp; Finkel, 2011; but see 
          Norton, Frost, &amp; Ariely, 2007). Indeed, the more accurately a perceiver views a new classmate, the more they interact with that classmate throughout the semester and come to like them by the end of the semester (
          Human, Sandstrom, et al., 2013). Targets also better like perceivers who view them more accurately and sit with them more frequently in class (
          Human, Sandstrom, et al., 2013). Thus, it does seem as though it could be very beneficial to be seen accurately, both personally and interpersonally.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Nevertheless, the potential downsides of judgeability do need to be examined, as being accurately perceived may not be beneficial in all situations or for all individuals. For example, individuals with very negative self-views may not benefit from being perceived accurately if this further reinforces negative self-views (
          North &amp; Swann, 2009). It is unclear, however, what the alternative, more preferable scenario would be for people with negative self-views, as individuals with negative self-views demonstrate more positive implicit and behavioral responses to negative compared with positive feedback (
          Ayduk, Gyurak, Akinola, &amp; Mendes, 2013), and positive feedback can have negative implications for low self-esteem individuals’ well-being (see 
          J. V. Wood, Perunovic, &amp; Lee, 2009).
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Overall, well-adjusted individuals are likely to experience many positive consequences as a result of their judgeability, perhaps further reinforcing their well-being. By helping to delineate the processes through which well-adjusted targets are seen more accurately, the current studies potentially inform interventions to improve judgeability. For example, rather than trying to modify an individuals’ well-being, which is possible but generally quite difficult (for review see 
          Lyubomirsky, Sheldon, &amp; Schkade, 2005), one could instead attempt to improve judgeability by targeting personality–behavior congruence. If successful, such interventions are in turn likely to have downstream positive consequences for targets.
        </p><a id="psp-106-2-286-EBADA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Limitations</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">There are several additional limitations of the current study. First, it remains unclear how generalizable these findings are across cultures. Our sample included a large proportion of East Asian targets, who were seen with significantly lower levels of distinctive accuracy (see 
          <a id="b-fn5"> </a><sup>footnote 5</sup>). This is consistent with findings that individuals with more interdependent self-construals are less expressive (
          Ekman, 1972; 
          Friesen, 1972; 
          Matsumoto, 1990; 
          Matsumoto &amp; Kupperbusch, 2001). Furthermore, our East Asian targets were significantly lower in personality–behavior congruence, in line with evidence that individuals with more interdependent self-construals may have less consistent personalities across roles and situations (
          Cross, Gore, &amp; Morris, 2003; 
          English &amp; Chen, 2007, 
          2011). This lower personality–behavior congruence and a tendency to be perceived as less attention-getting both contributed to East Asians’ lower judgeability in first impressions. However, recent work has demonstrated that even though individuals from interdependent cultures show less consistency across social roles, they still exhibit high consistency within social roles over time, which is associated with positive functioning (
          English &amp; Chen, 2007, 
          2011). Thus, it is possible that people from interdependent cultures could be just as judgeable within specific roles or the same relationship context, where interaction partners would have the opportunity to observe their behavior within the same role over time.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Of note, despite these cross-cultural differences in overall levels of judgeability and personality–behavior congruence, there was no evidence that the associations between target adjustment and judgeability differed as a function of target cultural background. That is, controlling for cultural background, well-adjusted individuals tended to exhibit greater personality–behavior congruence, which contributed to greater judgeability. However, our sample of East Asian targets were likely already quite acculturated to North American culture, making it important to examine whether these effects hold in more distinct cultural groups.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Another limitation of our study is that our sample of targets were predominantly female, who tend to be more judgeable, at least nonverbally (e.g., 
          Hall, 1979). Although we did not find any gender differences in our study, in line with previous research on target personality judgeability (
          Chan, Rogers, Parisotto, &amp; Biesanz, 2011; 
          Colvin, 1993b), our small sample of male targets may have limited our ability to detect these effects. An important next step will be to examine these questions with a larger sample of male targets in order to better examine whether there exist gender differences in the links between adjustment and judgeability.

This is because the information provided on any given page appears to be very relevant to the overall story, or personality, of the individual. Specifically, well-adjusted individuals are more likely to behave in line with their distinctive personality traits than less adjusted individuals, demonstrating greater distinctive personality–behavior congruence. Furthermore, when their story is also more interesting and engaging, well-adjusted individuals are seen even more accurately because the more relevant information that they provide is more likely to be detected and potentially better utilized. In contrast, well-adjusted individuals do not appear to be more judgeable because they are generally more attention-getting or because they provide more information. Nevertheless, each pathway examined here—cue relevance, availability, and detection—did promote judgeability and could be utilized by those wishing to be more accurately perceived. Being seen accurately, in turn, is likely to carry individual and interpersonal benefits for the target. In sum, well-adjusted individuals are seen more accurately because to their own selves, they are true.</p><a id="psp-106-2-286-R" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_127" title="Footnotes">Footnotes</a></span><a id="fn1" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><sup>1</sup> Note that if a person is perfectly normative it would not be possible to view them with distinctive accuracy. However, this is very rare: In our study, there were no targets whose personalities, as rated by the self and close others, perfectly matched our normative accuracy measure, the average self-report from a larger sample from the same population (the highest individual profile correlation was 
          <em>r</em> = .77). Furthermore, even though well-adjusted individuals tend to have more normative personalities, including in the current sample,

Of note, East Asian targets’ were significantly lower in distinctive personality–behavior congruence than Caucasian targets and were also rated as less attention-getting by perceivers (all 
          <em>p</em>s &lt; .05). In turn, both processes helped to account for East Asian targets’ lower judgeability (see 
          K. H. Rogers &amp; Biesanz, 2013, for further information on the relationships between accuracy and ethnicity in personality impressions).

          <em>f</em> and path 
          <em>h</em> influences the distribution of the indirect effect (e.g., see 
          Kenny, Korchmaros, &amp; Bolger, 2003). As this correlation was very small in the present study (
          <em>r</em> = .04), we considered this sufficiently small to warrant the use of the partial posterior 
          <em>p</em>-value, which assumes, under current implementations, that this correlation is 0. Note that (a) Kenny and Bolger’s (2003) approach represents a multilevel model generalization of Sobel’s test for mediation which has a substantially lower Type I error rate and consequently dramatically lower power than alternative methods for examining mediation, and (b) 
          <em>all</em> inferential methods for examining mediation are approximations.

We examined whether these relationships were moderated by trait observability, by including the mean observability rating for each of the 24 BFI items, based on 121 undergraduate students’ ratings (see 
          Human &amp; Biesanz, 2011a, 
          <a id="b-fn3"> </a><sup>footnote 3</sup>). Targets were significantly more likely to behave in line with their more observable traits (moderating path 
          <em>f</em>, 
          Figure 2B), and perceivers’ utilized significantly more behavioral information on high compared with low observability traits (moderating path 
          <em>h</em>, 
          Figure 2B; all 
          <em>p</em>s &lt; .0001). This effect was amplified for well-adjusted individuals, who were even more likely than less adjusted individuals to behave in line with their highly compared with less observable traits, three-way interaction 
          <em>b</em> = .06, 
          <em>z</em> = 21.30, 
          <em>p</em> &lt; .0001 (moderating path 
          <em>f</em>, 
          Figure 2B). Thus, well-adjusted individuals greater personality–behavior congruence may contribute more to their judgeability on more observable traits, perhaps because these types of traits have clearer behavioral manifestations and therefore are easier to behave in line with. No other meaningful differences across high and low observability traits emerged for the mechanisms discussed below.

<img src="http://imagesrvr.epnet.com/embimages/pdh/psp/psp-106-2-286-math28.gif"></img> provide an estimate of the average levels of distinctive accuracy direct effect and behavior utilization, respectively, on average across perceivers and targets, holding target adjustment constant at the mean (see 
            Table 1).
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Once again, standardized target adjustment was included as a moderator of each slope at Level 2, enabling an examination of whether the association between adjustment and distinctive accuracy,

            <em>d</em>, 
            Figure 2B) and also whether target adjustment moderates the extent to which perceivers’ utilize a target’s behavioral information,

            10 is reported as 
            <em>b</em>10) in line with these equations.
