We first confirmed that herders rely on strangers to a greater extent than do farmers for economic success (validation study). Next, we verified that farmers and herders understand the concept of ostracism, and its emotional consequences, in similar ways (Study 1). The studies that followed provided converging evidence that cultural group membership shapes sensitivity and responses to social exclusion. Using different methodologies, in Studies 2 and 3, we showed that, whereas the psychological consequences of ostracism by close others are similar for farmers and herders, herders are more strongly affected by ostracism from strangers. The last two studies demonstrated that herders recommend more affiliative responses to ostracism by strangers than do farmers both to those involved in the ostracism event (Study 4) and to naïve individuals (Study 5). Moreover, Study 5 revealed that the amount of time spent with strangers mediated cultural group differences in the extent to which affiliative and aggressive actions are recommended following social exclusion by strangers. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the economic systems on which communities are based shape how their members interact with others and that this, in turn, can shape individuals’ responses to social exclusion.

His livelihood depends on his interactions with strangers. He engages in negotiations with them and closes financial deals to sell the cattle and dairy products that he processes in collaboration with members of his family. Mahmut is motivated to ensure that these people recognize him as a reputable, cooperative, and agreeable person so that he can sell his produce for competitive prices and receive payment as promised. 
        <em>Kahraman</em> makes his living from farming. He relies far less on strangers—he interacts primarily with his immediate and extended family members, neighbors, and other residents of his village, from whom he receives help in harvesting tea. He sells his tea to a major state-owned company, so he does not need to search for a good buyer and engage in negotiations or competition for work-related reasons.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Mahmut and Kahraman pursue economic activities that afford different lifestyles. These different lifestyles, we argue, have important consequences for their interpersonal relationships. Whereas positive interactions with strangers are very important to Mahmut, they are of little economic consequence to Kahraman. In this article, we investigate the psychological impact of these relations on individuals’ reactions to social exclusion. In particular, we investigate the impact of being ostracized by close others versus strangers for members of farming and herding communities, as well as how individuals from these two groups respond to such ostracism.</p><a id="psp-106-5-752-EMDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_7" title="Belonging and Exclusion">Belonging and Exclusion</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Group living is essential to human survival. We learn the skills necessary to survive from our group members and cooperate with them in order to deal with the physical world (to build shelter, to hunt, to grow crops, etc.). Although the structure of human groups is very variable, almost without exception, humans live in the company of others. One result of this is that we have a fundamental and pervasive need to belong (
        Baumeister &amp; Leary, 1995). That is, we seek to engage in affiliative interactions with those around us and to form long-lasting bonds with our group members.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The importance we attach to belonging means that exclusion from the group is very painful for us (
        Eisenberger, Lieberman, &amp; Williams, 2003; 
        Williams, 2007). Indeed, being briefly excluded from an online ball game is sufficient to threaten participants’ basic psychological needs—reducing their sense of belonging, self-esteem, control, and even the extent to which they judge their existence to be meaningful (
        Williams, Cheung, &amp; Choi, 2000). Ostracism
        <a id="b-fn1"> </a><sup /> is so painful that it hurts even when being excluded is financially beneficial (
        van Beest &amp; Williams, 2006) and when participants are told that their exclusion is merely the result of a computer error (
        Zadro, Williams, &amp; Richardson, 2004). Findings such as these have led some researchers to postulate that we have an evolved mechanism to detect and react against ostracism (
        Williams, 2007).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">It follows that ostracism by those who are critical to our survival ought to be more painful than ostracism by those who are less important to us. Rather surprisingly, however, lab-based studies have not typically revealed support for this hypothesis. For example, ostracism is painful to us when those who exclude us are members of an outgroup (
        Smith &amp; Williams, 2004; 
        Williams, Cheung, &amp; Choi, 2000), even a despised outgroup (
        Gonsalkorale &amp; Williams, 2007). However, a recent diary study focusing on real-life social exclusion experiences showed that participants report feeling worse, and experience greater need threat, following ostracism by close others such as family members and close friends than following ostracism by acquaintances and strangers (
        Nezlek, Wesselmann, Wheeler, &amp; Williams, 2012). This finding is meaningful given the evolutionary importance of close others (e.g., 
        Roberts &amp; Dunbar, 2011; 
        Sutcliffe, Dunbar, Binder, &amp; Arrow, 2012).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Our relationship with those who ostracize us might affect not only our sensitivity to ostracism but also the types of reactions it provokes in us. In their model proposed to account for the diverse range of responses to rejection, 
        Smart Richman and Leary (2009) suggested that if the relationship with the rejecting individual or group is perceived to be of high value, and the cost of the rejection is high, then the rejected individual will be motivated to repair the broken relationship by engaging in affiliative and/or prosocial behaviors. However, if the relationship with the rejecting individual is perceived to be of low value, and the cost of rejection is low, then the rejected individual will be more likely to respond by aggressing or withdrawing.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In this research, we argue that which people matter to individuals’ survival is powerfully shaped by affordances of cultural contexts to which those individuals belong. This in turn influences how individuals react and respond to ostracism by different groups. The vast majority of research on social exclusion has been conducted within WEIRD cultures (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic [
        Henrich, Heine, &amp; Norenzayan, 2010], although see 
        Fiske &amp; Yamamoto, 2005, for an exception). Through looking at different cultural groups, we extend research on ostracism to novel populations and, in doing so, test key theoretical questions about cultural influences on social interdependencies and responses to ostracism.
      </p><a id="psp-106-5-752-ELDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_14" title="Cultural Affordances of Social Interdependence">Cultural Affordances of Social Interdependence</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Different sets of cultural affordances have been shown to shape people’s interdependencies with other individuals and groups (for reviews, see 
        Kitayama &amp; Uskul, 2011; 
        Markus &amp; Hamedani, 2007). Some of these affordances have been linked to the economic circumstances in a given society. Much of this work has focused on how socioeconomic status (e.g., 
        Lachman &amp; Weaver, 1998; 
        Snibbe &amp; Markus, 2005; 
        Stephens, Markus, &amp; Townsend, 2007) and the level of economic development (
        Greenfield, Maynard, &amp; Childs, 2003; 
        Inglehart &amp; Baker, 2000; 
        Loucky, 1976; 
        Kağıtçıbaşı &amp; Ataca, 2005) or material abundance (
        Adams, Bruckmüller, &amp; Decker, 2012) within a culture shape social interdependence among its members.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Economic differences between groups can arise not only from variations in the amount of accumulated wealth or patterns of resource distribution but also from engagement in different types of economic activities that afford different kinds of interpersonal relationships and interdependencies. In this articles, we investigate how the economic structure of different groups influences the nature of social relations within those groups and how this, in turn, influences responses to ostracism. In order to do this, we work with two economic groups: farmers and herders. We adopt a definition of culture that focuses on how psychological processes may be shaped by the sociocultural worlds that people occupy (e.g., 
        Adams, 2005; 
        Adams &amp; Markus, 2001, 
        2004; 
        Kroeber &amp; Kluckhohn, 1952; 
        Markus &amp; Hamedani, 2007). Using this perspective, we conceptualize economic communities as cultural groups in that they prescribe certain meanings, institutional practices, and ways of being (see also 
        Berry, 1979; 
        Berry et al., 1986).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Previous research with farming and herding communities has concentrated on how making a living from farming versus herding influences the level of social interdependence within a culture. Farming typically requires harmonious group collaboration. Moreover, farmers are tied to the land they cultivate and, thus, to fixed communities. In contrast, herding activities do not require much cooperation, but rely on individual decision making and autonomy. Furthermore, herders are typically not so strongly tied to particular plots of land; their capital can be moved to any location with enough nutrition for their animals.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">These characteristics of the lifestyles afforded by the requirements of the economic activity pursued by each group have been suggested to breed interdependence among farmers and independence among herders. Research has indeed shown that farmers tend to show a high degree of social interdependence resulting in stronger emphasis on conformity (
        Berry, 1967; 
        Barry, Child, &amp; Bacon, 1959), consultation among members and acting collectivistically (
        Edgerton, 1965), higher degrees of compliance, conscientiousness, and conservatism in child-rearing practices (
        Barry et al., 1959), and a greater tendency to perceive objects as embedded within their surrounding fields (
        Berry, 1966; 
        Uskul, Kitayama, &amp; Nisbett, 2008). Herders, in contrast, tend to show a lesser degree of social interdependence, resulting in individualistic social orientations (
        Edgerton, 1971; 
        Witkin &amp; Berry, 1975), independent decision making (
        Barry et al., 1959; 
        Berry, 1967), individualism and assertiveness in child-rearing practices (
        Barry et al., 1959), and greater tendency to perceive objects as separate from their surrounding fields (
        Berry, 1966; 
        Uskul et al., 2008).

We have chosen to work with tea farmers and herders in the Eastern Black Sea region in Turkey where clear differences exist in the extent to which members of the respective communities have to rely on competition, negotiation, and interaction with individuals they hardly know.
        <a id="b-fn2"> </a><sup /></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Working in this region allows the implementation of a powerful natural experiment because the farming and herding groups share the same national identity, ethnicity, language, religion, and geographic area but differ in the nature of their social relationships shaped by economic demands. These features of the region were exploited in previous research conducted with farmers and herders who were matched on a variety of factors but differed in the type of economic activity pursued for survival, which showed that farmers exhibited a stronger holistic style compared with herders in tasks assessing attention, categorization, and reasoning (
        Uskul et al., 2008).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In the Eastern Black Sea region of Turkey, tea farming is the most common agricultural practice, and it leads to the harvest of three to four crops a year. Production typically takes place in small to medium-sized fields owned by families. Reliance on members of the immediate and extended families and on neighbors is common during the harvest seasons. Tea is a consumer staple in Turkey; hence, the government is heavily involved in the regulation of the tea industry. Although competitive transactions have become more common due to the establishment of private tea companies in recent years, most tea is still purchased and handled by a state-owned company (and some transactions are overseen by local cooperatives rather than by individuals). As a result, farmers in this region tend to be producers only and do not typically engage in competitive, commercial activity with individuals outside of their immediate social circle.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In contrast, herders are both producers and commercialists; they sell cattle and dairy products to factories and commercial enterprises, as well as to local people at weekly markets in neighboring towns. Consequently, they regularly interact with individuals outside of their immediate social circle (who they do not know at all or know only superficially). Given the importance of these interactions for their livelihood, we expected herders to feel motivated to pursue positive relationships with strangers in order to ensure that they are respected, recognized, and valued by them, including after experiencing social problems with them.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In the present research, we thus suggest that living in different economic settings that afford different types of realities would foster different types of interdependencies. For farmers, social interdependencies are likely to be stronger with close others than with distant others, whereas for herders, the boundaries between close and distant others are likely to be less clear-cut. Using 
        Smart Richman and Leary’s (2009) terms, given their interdependence with strangers, herders, when compared with farmers, should value relationships with strangers more and perceive the costs of being rejected by them to be higher.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Given these group differences in the nature of social interdependencies grounded in economic activity, we predicted differences in how members of farming and herding communities would be affected by, and respond to, social exclusion by close others and strangers. We hypothesized differential sensitivity to the source of ostracism such that, in this region, herders would be more negatively affected by ostracism from strangers than would farmers. Moreover, we predicted that herders would be more likely to engage in reparative actions such as endorsing affiliative responses (and less likely to engage in actions that would further harm the relationship, such as endorsing aggressive responses) to ostracizers and naïve others following exclusion by strangers. Here, we define 
        <em>strangers</em> in broad terms. Although our predictions are rooted within economic differences between farmers and herders, they are not limited to ostracism-related responses to strangers on whom individuals rely directly for economic reasons. Rather, we expect a generalized tendency in responses to ostracism by all strangers as any stranger might (or not) have the potential to become an economic partner or a customer at any point in the future.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Some support for the hypothesis that strangers matter more in some cultures than others has been provided by 
        Fiske and Yamamoto (2005), who showed that Japanese participants are less strongly influenced by stranger-induced ostracism than are American participants. One interpretation of these results is that relationships with strangers matter less to Japanese people, thus leading them to be less strongly affected by ostracism from them. However, these results are difficult to interpret, as the authors did not have a close other comparison condition.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We predicted no differences between herders’ and farmers’ reactions to ostracism induced by close others. This prediction is based on previous research highlighting the universal importance of close others (e.g., kin and close friends; see, 
        Roberts, &amp; Dunbar, 2011; 
        Sutcliffe et al., 2012) and our own field observations that indicate that members of both communities have very close social ties with members of their families, neighbors, and other residents in their village (also see early ethnographic work in the same region by 
        Bellér-Hann &amp; Hann, 2000; 
        Hann, 1990). Individuals in both groups spend extensive social time with each other in their homes as well as in public places such as coffee houses. Furthermore, they attend community events such as weddings and funerals and support each other during difficult times. We thus predicted that members of both communities would be equally negatively affected by being ostracized by close others and would not differ in the types of responses they endorse in the face of social exclusion by close others.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">One outstanding question was whether we would find sex differences in the two cultural groups. Our field observations revealed that the female members of the herding communities tended to be responsible for the production of the dairy products, such as butter and cheese, and other animal products, such as animal skin and pelts. Male members, however, were more likely to engage with strangers for trade purposes. That said, it was not uncommon to see female members of these communities selling dairy products at markets and hence interacting with strangers. The division of labor in the farming communities seemed more equal in relation to the main economic activity; both men and women engaged in harvesting the tea, drying it, and selling it to the tea companies for further processing. It is thus possible that we would find a Cultural Group × Sex interaction. However, our field observations also made us aware that attitudes of female members of the herding communities are likely to be shaped by the experiences of the male members of these communities, who regularly share their daily experiences (inside and outside of their villages) with members of their families. On the basis of these observations, we suspect that it may not be only engaging in particular economic activities that produces cultural differences, but also that these economic activities require people to develop different habits, skills, and attitudes, and these habits, skills, and attitudes pervade the culture more generally. This intuition is supported by a recent developmental study conducted within these communities that revealed that young children from the two groups (who do not typically engage in economic activities) differ in their responses to ostracism (
        Over &amp; Uskul, 2013). Thus, overall, we did not predict sex differences in the sensitivity and responses to exclusion by strangers in the two communities.

Before describing these studies, we report the findings from a validation study in which we aimed to confirm expert views and field observations concerning the number of strangers with whom farmers and herders interact and spend time with for work-related purposes. Next, we report findings from a study in which an open-ended interview method was used to explore understandings of the concept of ostracism among farmers and herders (Study 1). This enabled us to ensure that ostracism was understood similarly among the members of these two cultural groups and that the findings resulting from the remaining studies could not be attributed to a lack of conceptual equivalence.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We examined psychological reactions to ostracism incidents induced by close others or strangers using a recall task in Study 2 and a vignette approach in Study 3. In Studies 4 and 5, we investigated responses to ostracism by close others or strangers using scenarios depicting incidents of social exclusion by close others versus strangers. In Study 4, we investigated how individuals from the two communities recommend responding to ostracisers, and, in Study 5, investigated how they recommend responding to new individuals following ostracism by others.

        <em>Artvin</em>. Artvin, located in northeastern Turkey at the Georgian border, is a northern neighbor of Erzurum. Rize is located on the eastern Black Sea coast, surrounded by the sea in the North and sharply rising mountains in the South. One of the leading sources of income for the inhabitants of the villages in Artvin and Erzurum is animal husbandry, mostly cattle and sheep breeding. Tea farming is the main source of income for the inhabitants of most villages in Rize. Both farming and herding communities in this region are nonnomadic. The region where Rize, Artvin, and Erzurum are located is occupied primarily by ethnic Turks. Islam is the predominant religion. The principal language spoken is Turkish.

Participants were approached at home, in public spaces (e.g., coffee houses, streets), or on tea or grazing fields during work. The sex of the interviewer and the sex of the participant were always matched. After interviewers introduced themselves and the general goals of the project, they asked individuals for their consent to take part in the study. Individuals who agreed were then introduced the tasks verbally and read out the study questions.

When answers contained recall tasks or lengthy descriptions, responses were tape-recorded and later transcribed for analysis. When questions contained Likert-type response options, interviewers noted participants’ responses on the questionnaire. When participants needed assistance with the use of Likert scales, interviewers provided clarification on the meaning of available response options. Interviewers always clarified any issues raised by participants and checked with them to make sure that the scenarios or questions were correctly understood. Upon completion of each study, participants were given a detailed overview of the goals of the project and handed a small gift for their participation (male participants received a torch and female participants received a small purse). These general methods were pilot-tested in the region and their utility confirmed in prior work (

Most participants reported having at least an elementary school degree, with younger people having higher levels of education on average than the elderly. Participants recruited in both communities were comparable to each other in terms of most demographic characteristics; one notable difference emerged in annual income with herders reporting less annual income than did farmers. As in previous work conducted with these groups (see 
        Uskul et al., 2008), income differences did not affect the reported findings in this article. In none of the Studies 1–5 did we find evidence for sex differences in the outcome variables.

Participants answered both questions by indicating a number in an open-ended response format. If they had difficulty responding to either of these questions, they were encouraged to provide an approximate number. The third question inquired about the amount of time they spent with strangers, by selecting one of the five options presented in a Likert-type format (from 1 =

We therefore first checked for outliers in the data set and ran the analyses after excluding seven participants whose responses fell three standard deviations above the mean in either Q1 or Q2, leaving 
          <em>N</em> = 179.

          <em>SD</em> = 30.14, range = 0–200) individuals whom they had met before but did not know closely. The responses to these open-ended questions provided count data with positively skewed distributions (skewness statistic for Q1: 3.60 and Q2: 4.81). Although a Poisson regression model is often used to analyze count data, when the variance of the dependent variable is greater than the mean (as was the case here for both questions), a negative binomial regression (NBR) is more appropriate (
          Coxe, West, &amp; Aiken, 2009). Thus, we used NBR to analyze the count data associated with each of the open-ended questions separately, using cultural group and participant sex as independent variables.

With the exception of six participants (three in each cultural group), who gave responses that were irrelevant or too vague to be coded (e.g., ostracism originates from ignorance; ostracism is a bad thing), all participants’ responses referenced one or more of the aspects of ostracism listed above. These definitions overlap with definitions of social exclusion cited elsewhere (e.g., 
            Twenge, Baumeister, Tice, &amp; Stucke, 2001; 
            Williams, 2007) and, importantly, show that both farmers and herders share a similar understanding of what ostracism is.

            <a id="b-fn7"> </a><sup /> When participants’ responses were coded using one of these two categories, Fisher’s exact test did not yield significant differences between the groups: The number of participants giving responses that fell in the “refusal to interact” category (
            <em>n</em>farmers = 5, 
            <em>n</em>herders = 6) and the “making someone look bad” category (
            <em>n</em>farmers = 8,

These responses overlap with emotions typically observed in studies designed to examine the emotional consequences of ostracism (for a review, see 
            Williams, 2007). With the exception of one participant who failed to provide a relevant response, all participants’ responses mentioned one or more of the above emotional consequences, thus yielding no group difference.
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We can thus conclude that members of the farming and herding communities understand the concept of ostracism, and the behaviors that are associated with it, in similar ways. Furthermore, members of the two communities predict that ostracism will have similar emotional consequences. These findings provided support for conceptual equivalence that addresses whether the examined concept makes similar sense in the studied groups (
            Fontaine, 2011) and gave us confidence that we could go on to examine cultural similarities and differences in sensitivity to ostracism and responses to it in these two groups.

However, we predicted that members of herding communities would be more negatively affected by ostracism from strangers compared with members of farming communities. In order to test these predictions, we asked participants to recall and relive an occasion on which they had been ostracized by a close other (or close others) and a stranger (or strangers) and then assess the effects of these experiences on their belonging, self-esteem, perceived control, meaningful existence, and mood following the commonly assessed indicators of ostracism-related distress (see review by 
        Williams &amp; Zadro, 2005).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We chose to use a recall task in this study because (a) social exclusion has been shown to be easily relived (

Participants’ descriptions in each condition were tape-recorded and later transcribed. The order of the two exclusion conditions was counterbalanced (findings did not vary as a function of the order of the exclusion conditions). In a distractor task used between the conditions, participants were asked to orally list as many words as they could think of starting with the letter

They also completed two items assessing mood (“I felt angry,” “I felt sad”). Finally, participants responded to two manipulation check questions designed to assess how close (or distant) the individual involved in the recalled ostracism event was perceived to be (“At the time of this event, how well did you know this individual [these individuals]?” from 1 [

Nevertheless, as we had a small sample size and thus low power, we decomposed this nonsignificant interaction effect to confirm that both farmers and herders regarded close others to be “closer” than strangers. This analysis allowed us to confirm that the manipulation was effective for both samples and to rule out the possibility that herders do not differentiate between close others and strangers. This analysis showed that farmers and herders evaluated the person recalled in the close other exclusion condition equally close (

First, the number of participants included in the analyses was small due to some members of the cultural groups having difficulty recalling a relevant ostracism event. Although similar numbers of farmers and herders across both recall tasks failed to recall a relevant ostracism event, the specific reasons for such failure in either group remain unknown. Second, the recall method used in this study leaves open to the possibility that farmers and herders recalled different ostracism experiences that led to different emotional reports. Third, although the interviewers tried to familiarize themselves with the potential participants prior to data collection, having been interviewed by a stranger might have triggered different recall experiences among the members of the two cultural groups that have differential social experiences with individuals with whom they are not closely familiar. Finally, some of the events recalled by participants in this study did not include strangers per se, but rather acquaintances (as indicated by the manipulation check). To address these limitations, in Study 3 we used a vignette method to test the impact of imagining being ostracized by close others versus strangers on the commonly assessed indicators of ostracism-induced stress.</p><a id="psp-106-5-752-EDDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_90" title="Study 3">Study 3</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We conducted Study 3 with a goal of replicating the pattern of findings observed in Study 2, using a different method that would allow us to overcome the limitations of the recall method used.

All participants were read two vignettes, presented in a counterbalanced order, one depicting a situation in which they were asked to imagine being socially excluded by a group of people consisting of close others and another depicting a situation in which they were asked to imagine being socially excluded by a group of people consisting of strangers.

In both vignettes, we matched the sex of the individuals in the ostracizing group to the participant’s sex. The close other exclusion vignette used for women read as follows:

            
<blockquote>Imagine you are waiting at a bus stop on your way to the nearby town. There are other women from your village waiting for the bus. Everyone knows each other well. Other women start chatting among themselves. At the beginning they talk to you as well, but after a while they start excluding you from the conversation. You try to be part of the conversation but no one responds to what you have to say. The bus is delayed so the conversation goes on for some time. During this time, the other villagers continue to leave you out of the conversation.</blockquote>
The stranger exclusion vignette read the same except for the second sentence, which emphasized that the group consisted of strangers: “These are women from different villages waiting for the bus. No one at the stop knows each other; they are strangers.” The two vignettes were presented in a counterbalanced order (the order of the vignettes did not significantly interact with other independent variables). We used the same distractor task as in Study 2 between the two vignettes. Following each vignette, participants responded to the same list of items used in Study 2 to assess perceived levels of belonging, self-esteem, control, meaningful existence, and mood, using the same 5e-point scale (from 1 [
            <em>not at all</em>] to 5 [

          <em>d</em> = 1.72). Again, this overall pattern held for each of the three measured constructs, except for meaningful existence need on which herders responded similarly in the close other and stranger exclusion conditions (see 
          Table 3 for specific comparisons and relevant statistics).
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">This study revealed findings comparable to those obtained in Study 2, which required participants to recall and relive an ostracism episode that they personally experienced in the past. Specifically, using a vignette method that required participants to imagine themselves being ostracized by a group of close others or strangers, we found additional support for the hypothesis that farmers and herders would show differential sensitivity to the source of ostracism. As predicted, compared with farmers, herders reported that they would be affected more negatively if ostracized by strangers, reporting higher levels of belonging and meaningful existence threat and negative mood, whereas the two groups did not differ in their responses when asked to imagine being ostracized by a group of close others. Both groups reported that they would be more negatively affected by being ostracized by close others than by strangers; however, this difference was bigger for farmers than for herders across all three indicators of ostracism-induced stress.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In summary, using a recall method in Study 2 and a vignette method in Study 3, we established that herders show greater sensitivity to being ostracized by strangers than do farmers. If strangers are more important to herders than they are to farmers and have greater impact on their basic needs and mood when ostracized by them, then there should also be differences in responses recommended in the face of ostracism by strangers. In particular, herders should recommend more affiliative responses, which might help them regain approval from, and inclusion by, ostracizing strangers. To test this possibility, in Study 4, we examined cultural differences in norms for how to respond to ostracism by close others and strangers.</p><a id="psp-106-5-752-ECDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_103" title="Study 4">Study 4</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In this study, we investigated how members of farming and herding communities recommend an individual should respond to ostracism by close others and strangers. To that end, we presented participants with a hypothetical scenario in which an individual was described as being excluded either by a group of close others or by a group of strangers and collected their open-ended recommendations for how the ostracized person should react. We then coded these responses as representing affiliation, withdrawal, or aggression following the main categories identified in previous work on ostracism (e.g., fight, flight, and tend-and-befriend; see 
        Smart Richman &amp; Leary, 2009 and 
        Williams, 2007, for reviews; see also 
        MacDonald &amp; Kingsbury, 2006; 
        Taylor et al., 2000). We predicted that herders would recommend affiliative responses (which would help them repair the broken relationship) to ostracism by strangers more often than would farmers. As in Studies 2 and 3, we predicted no cultural difference in responses recommended for ostracism by close others.

For male participants, the target person was called Mahmut, and the individuals making up the group waiting at the bus stop were described as men. For female participants, the target person was called Selma, and the individuals making up the group waiting at the bus stop were described as women. The scenarios used in this study were matched to the vignettes used in Study 3 as closely as possible.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The close other-induced ostracism scenario read as follows (here we provide as an example the scenario used with women):

            
<blockquote>A group of women are waiting at the bus stop on their way to the nearby town. These are women from the same village who know each other quite well. One of these women is Selma. Those who are waiting for the bus start chatting among themselves. At the beginning they talk to Selma as well, but after a while they start excluding her from the conversation. Selma tries to be part of the conversation but no one responds to what she has to say. The bus is delayed so the conversation goes on for some time. During this time, the other villagers continue leaving Selma out of the conversation.</blockquote>
The stranger-induced ostracism condition read the same except for the second sentence, which emphasized that the group consisted of strangers: “These are women from different villages who have never met before and are strangers to each other.” The two scenarios were presented in a counterbalanced order (findings did not vary as a function of the order of the scenarios). The same distractor task as in Studies 2 and 3 was used between the two scenarios, which required participants to generate as many words as possible starting with the letter 
            <em>D</em> for 2–3 min.
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Following each scenario, participants were asked to indicate how they thought the situation would impact Selma, using a 5-point scale (from 1 [
            <em>very negatively</em>] to 5 [
            <em>very positively</em>]). Next, using an open-ended format, they were asked to indicate what actions they thought Selma should adopt in response to the situation described in the scenario. Finally, in order to check whether the depicted situations were viewed as equally plausible in both communities, we asked participants to indicate how plausible it would be for the described event to happen to someone in a village in their region (from 1 [
            <em>not plausible at all</em>] to 5 [
            <em>very plausible</em>]).

With the exception of seven responses to the close other ostracism scenario (

            <em>n</em>farmers = 1, 
            <em>n</em>herders = 3) that were too ambiguous to be coded (e.g., Selma should not feel sad; Selma should choose her friends carefully), all responses were coded to fit one of these three categories. The agreement with a second coder, who was blind to study hypotheses and the conditions of the study, was above 90% for both the close other and the stranger ostracism scenarios. Disagreements were resolved by discussion.
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Withdrawal actions referred to behaviors involving leaving (e.g., she should leave the situation), doing nothing (e.g., she should wait for the bus and do nothing), or ignoring the situation or those involved (e.g., she should not mind them, ignore them). Affiliative actions referred to actions involving adjusting (e.g., she should adjust to the group), being nice to the group (e.g., she should behave in a friendly way toward the group), or correcting or fixing one’s own actions (e.g., she should behave differently and think about the situation). Aggressive actions referred to those indicating disagreement with the treatment (e.g., scolding them by saying why on earth they don’t speak with her). As shown in 
            Table 4, only a few participants in each group endorsed aggressive responses (perhaps because aggressive actions were perceived to be less socially acceptable in the situations depicted in the scenarios, which involved one person being ostracized by a group of other people waiting in the same location). We therefore do not discuss this category further.

            <em>p</em> = .13, 
            <em>d</em> = .21. There was no significant main effect of cultural group indicating that members of the two groups did not differ from each other in how plausible they thought it would be for a person to experience the incidents described in the scenarios, 
            <em>F</em>(1, 67) &lt; 1, 
            <em>ns</em>. Importantly, type of scenario and cultural group did not interact significantly, 
            <em>F</em>(1, 67) &lt; 1,

Not surprisingly, in all conditions, participants evaluated the event as having a negative impact on the target person (i.e., all ratings were on the negative end of the scale below the midpoint). There were no significant main effects of cultural group (
            <em>F</em> &lt; 1,

            <em>M</em> = 1.86,

            <em>p</em> = .20, 
            <em>d</em> = .31, they differed in their perception of the impact that stranger-induced ostracism would have on the target person. Herders (
            <em>M</em> = 1.75, 
            <em>SD</em> = .73) tended to view this event as having more negative impact on the target person than did farmers (

            <em>p</em> = .06, 
            <em>d</em> = .45. This finding converges with the finding from Studies 2 and 3 demonstrating that herders reported more negative consequences of being ostracized by strangers than did farmers. Thus, compared with farmers, herders perceive stranger-induced ostracism as being associated with more negative psychological consequences regardless of whether they or a hypothetical other are the target of exclusion.

          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The relative importance of strangers to herders was thus associated with a greater likelihood of endorsing affiliative responses following ostracism by them. This social norm may allow them to repair their relationship with strangers and thus maintain their important economic connections. Farmers, who are less reliant on relationships with strangers, tend to withdraw from interactions with strangers following ostracism, presumably because they are less invested in the relationship. Importantly, this difference was observed in the absence of a cultural group difference in how plausible social exclusion by close others and strangers were perceived to be.</p><a id="psp-106-5-752-EBDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_127" title="Study 5">Study 5</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In Study 4, we demonstrated that herders attempt to repair specific relationships with strangers that have broken down. The vast majority of experimental work on ostracism, however, has focused not on how individuals respond to ostracizers but on how they respond to new people following an experience of ostracism (for reviews, see 
        Smart Richman &amp; Leary, 2009; 
        Williams, 2007) and has shown that ostracism creates a general threat that influences social interactions beyond the immediate situation. If ostracism by strangers really is worse for herders, then this might also influence how they respond to individuals not involved in the original ostracism event. Thus, the goal of the final study was to examine farmers’ and herders’ reactions to a novel person following a social exclusion event induced either by close others or by strangers.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Research has shown that, following an experience of ostracism, individuals may seek to reengage with others by conforming, imitating, cooperating, and affiliating with new individuals (e.g., 
        Lakin, Chartrand, &amp; Arkin, 2008; 
        Maner, DeWall, Baumeister, &amp; Schaller, 2007; 
        Williams et al., 2000). Such strategies can help individuals reduce the pain experienced as a result of social exclusion and seek a sense of belonging with other people. Research has also shown that not all responses to naïve others following social exclusion events are positive; they may also be of an aggressive nature (e.g., 
        Gaertner &amp; Iuzzini, 2005; 
        Twenge et al., 2001, 
        2007; 
        Warburton, Williams, &amp; Cairns, 2006). The situational and individual level factors that might determine whether affiliative or aggressive responses may be adopted remain unclear (see 
        Smart Richman &amp; Leary, 2009, for a review). In this study, we examined the likelihood with which actions that would help the ostracized person regain social acceptance (via affiliative responses) or actions that would put the ostracized person in confrontation with naïve others (via aggressive responses) are recommended by members of farming and herding communities. In this way, we investigated economic activity and source of ostracism as potential factors that might shape people’s responses in the wake of social exclusion.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">To that end, we presented participants with extended versions of the scenarios used in Study 4. In the continuation of the scenario, Selma (Mahmut) was described as encountering a naïve other (a person not involved in the original social exclusion incident) after reaching the market in two different situations. One situation described an encounter with a naïve other, which, due to an accident, caused slight annoyance for the ostracized person and was designed to explore the extent to which affiliative responses would be recommended (we call this the 
        <em>innocent incident</em> from now on). Another situation described an encounter with a naïve other, which involved a rude behavior on the part of this new person directed to the ostracized person and was designed to explore the extent to which aggressive responses would be recommended (we call this the 
        <em>rude incident</em> from now on). For both situations, we presented participants with forced-choice options representing affiliation, withdrawal, and aggression. We opted for a forced-choice option in this study because we observed that members of both groups were able to spontaneously produce responses in these three categories in Study 3 and with the goal of reducing the number of ambiguous responses and perhaps increasing participants’ willingness to recommend aggressive responses.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We hypothesized that, compared with farmers, herders would be more likely to affiliate with, and less likely to aggress against, persons they meet following a social exclusion incident induced by strangers. As before, we predicted no group differences in affiliative or aggressive tendencies against naïve others following a social exclusion incident induced by close others. Finally, we tested whether the amount of time spent with strangers would account for cultural group differences in the type of actions recommended by participants.</p><a id="psp-106-5-752-EBBDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Participants and design</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Fifty-two farmers (26 women;

Response options reflected behaviors that involved an aggressive act, an affiliative act, or an act involving withdrawal. The order of the scenarios was counterbalanced and the order of responses was randomized. The innocent incident and the response options to follow read:

Specifically, compared with farmers, herders recommended more affiliative actions in the face of the innocent incident and fewer aggressive actions in the face of the rude incident. An inspection of within-group differences revealed that whereas farmers made a stronger distinction between ostracism by strangers and close others than did herders, herders opted for the affiliative and withdrawal actions equally frequently regardless of whether the ostracism was induced by close others or strangers. These findings support the prediction that members of the herding community, who rely more on unknown others for their livelihood and are negatively affected by exclusion from them (as shown in Studies 2 and 3), have a greater motive to undo the pain associated with being excluded by strangers via interacting positively with naïve individuals. These findings, in line with other observations in the social exclusion literature, demonstrate that social exclusion has far-reaching consequences going beyond the initial exclusion incident.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Time spent with strangers as a potential mediator</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Finally, we tested whether the observed group differences in psychological responses to stranger-induced ostracism could be accounted for by the amount of time the members of the two cultural groups spend interacting with individuals they do not know or know very little. To that aim, we first recoded responses into two binary variables with two levels each: affiliative versus other (i.e., withdrawal and aggressive) in the innocent incident and aggressive versus other (i.e., withdrawal and affiliative) in the rude incident and ran the regressions to establish the necessary steps before conducting the meditational analyses (
            Baron &amp; Kenny, 1986). Replicating the finding observed in the validation study, cultural group (farmers = 0, herders = 1) significantly predicted the amount of time spent with strangers (

This finding provides evidence for the important role of an external variable afforded by the relevant cultural context in explaining group differences in social relationships.</p><a id="psp-106-5-752-EADA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_153" title="General Discussion">General Discussion</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In the present research, we investigated how differences in economic activities shape the nature of the social relationships within a community and thus psychological reactions and responses to ostracism. In particular, we tested how farmers and herders respond to ostracism by close others and strangers. We first confirmed that herders rely on strangers to a greater extent than do farmers for economic success (validation study). Next, we verified that farmers and herders understand the concept of ostracism, and its emotional consequences, in similar ways (Study 1). The studies that followed provided converging evidence that cultural group membership shapes sensitivity and responses to social exclusion. Using a recall method in Study 2 and a vignette method in Study 3, we showed that, whereas the psychological consequences of ostracism by close others are similar for farmers and herders, herders are more strongly affected by ostracism from strangers. In two further studies, we showed that herders recommend more affiliative responses to ostracism by strangers than do farmers both to those involved in the ostracism event (Study 4) and to naïve individuals (Study 5). Moreover, Study 5 revealed that the amount of time spent with strangers mediates group differences in the extent to which affiliative and aggressive actions are recommended following social exclusion by strangers, with greater time spent with strangers mediating herders’ greater endorsement of affiliative responses in an incident involving an unintended accident and weaker endorsement of aggressive responses in an incident that may call for a conflict.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Recent research has suggested that ostracism by close others is more painful than ostracism by strangers (
        Nezlek et al., 2012). Here we demonstrate that, although this is true for farmers, not all cultural groups differentiate to the same extent between ostracism by close others and strangers. This, we argue, depends at least in part on the role played by strangers in one’s livelihood. Individuals who rely on strangers for economic success respond more negatively to ostracism by them and respond to it with more affiliative behaviors.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">More generally, the present research contributes to a small but growing body of evidence suggesting that individual and situational factors moderate responses to social exclusion (e.g., 
        Ayduk, Downey, Testa, Yen, &amp; Shoda, 1999; 
        Downey, Frietas, Michaelis, &amp; Khouri, 1998; 
        Zadro, Boland, &amp; Richardson, 2006; see also 
        Williams, 2007, for a review). Previous research has suggested that sensitivity to ostracism is an evolved trait that enables detection of social-threatening responses and fosters adaptive responses to it (
        Gonsalkorale &amp; Williams, 2007). Here we provide systematic evidence that, although ostracism is negatively responded to across communities, the extent of the negative responses it engenders, as well as the types of responses that are deemed appropriate, are culturally variable.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Unlike the majority of research investigating ostracism, our evidence comes from understudied cultural groups. Participants in the present research belong to two economic groups that form the second largest employment sector (agricultural sector) in the world economy (following the services sector) and make up about one third of the world’s population (
        International Labour Office, 2011). Moreover, the studied region (and the country in which it is located) is non-Western and is part of a country whose democracy score is far from satisfactory.
        <a id="b-fn13"> </a><sup /> Our samples are nonindustrial, less educated than those typically used in psychological research, and not rich (either by Turkish or by universal standards). Thus, the present work adds to the existing database of psychological research that originates primarily from middle-class White American samples (
        Arnett, 2008). Our results lead us to caution against focusing exclusively on research conducted with WEIRD populations (
        Henrich et al., 2010) and making broad generalizations from very limited samples when constructing evolutionary accounts of ostracism.
      </p><a id="psp-106-5-752-ECADA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Broader Implications and Questions for Future Research</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The present research has implications for relationship models discussed in social and cultural psychology. For example, the present findings are relevant for the patterns of relationships typically seen as normative within individualistic and collectivitistic cultures. Previous research has discussed promotion and maintenance of harmony as a typical characteristic of collectivistic cultures. In the present study, we find that the less collectivistic group (herders: see 
          Uskul et al., 2008) exhibited a greater tendency to suggest avoidance of conflict with those who may be relied on for economic reasons. Furthermore, our results suggest that defining ingroups and outgroups in less categorical and more functional and relational terms (as proposed by Yuki and colleagues; 
          Brewer &amp; Yuki, 2007; 
          Yuki, 2003) may be a more suitable approach to understanding social relationships (at least in the cultural contexts examined in this project). Such an approach would be helpful in understanding herders’ similar treatment of close others and strangers in a context in which individual relationships can take less voluntary and more inescapable forms of connections (see 
          Adams, Anderson, &amp; Adonu, 2004), shaped by local economic demands.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The present findings also have relevance for our understanding of the origins of individualism and collectivism. As 
          Triandis (1989) described, one potential root of differences along this dimension are differences in cultural complexity. High cultural complexity may result in being loyal to a large number of ingroups, not just one or two. This pattern of relating to others may result in higher levels of individualism. In the present work, we show that herders rely on and have the motivation to be affiliative to a greater number of individuals than do farmers. This could potentially explain the previously observed cognitive style differences among members of these two communities (see 
          Uskul et al., 2008), which demonstrated that herders exhibited lower levels of holistic cognitive style compared with farmers. This group difference was then explained by differences in the degree to which these two communities reinforce either independence of the self from others or interdependence of the self with others due to the nature of the daily economic activities pursued by the members of these two communities. This explanation did not specify which aspect of the economic activities would be responsible for encouraging interdependence over independence, or vice versa. The present study suggests that higher levels of commercialism, resulting in greater cultural complexity, which encourages interactions with strangers among herders, might be a likely factor leading to lower degree of holistic cognition in this group
          <a id="b-fn14"> </a><sup /> (see also 
          Greenfield et al., 2003; 
          Kağıtçıbaşı &amp; Ataca, 2005; 
          Loucky, 1976). Further research is needed to test this argument.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">It is interesting to note that we found a sex difference in the validation study, indicating that it was primarily male herders, but not farmers, who reported interacting with a higher number of strangers for work-related reasons. In the main studies, however, we detected no sex differences, as expected. It appears that in the measures included in the present studies assessing psychological responses to ostracism, economic activity played a much more important role than did participants’ sex. One possibility, however, is that we failed to observe sex differences due to the relatively small sample sizes. It is worth noting, however, that sex differences have not typically been reported in research on social exclusion, even with larger sample sizes (e.g., 
          Williams &amp; Sommer, 1997). Moreover, in previous work with herders and farmers in the same region, no sex differences were reported in the extent to which holistic or analytic cognitive styles were endorsed (
          Uskul et al., 2008). At first glance, this might seem counterintuitive because men are more likely than women to engage in the economic activities, especially in the herding communities. We suggest, however, that dominant forms of economic activity endorsed by a community are likely to influence the degree to which the community as a whole interacts with others (and thus be influenced in similar degrees when they get ostracized by them or recommend similar reactions). All members of the community are, therefore, likely to be shaped regardless of whether they directly engage in the economic activities at issue or not (also see 
          Over &amp; Uskul, 2013). Future research could investigate this claim more directly.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">A further point of interest is that we see a generalized pattern of responses to strangers. As predicted, we observed group differences in responses to social exclusion by strangers broadly defined and not to specific strangers defined as economic partners. This may be due to herders’ perception of strangers as potential customers or trade partners at some point in the future. Thus, the implications of pursuing a specific type of economic activity can be relatively far-reaching and associated with broad psychological and social relationship patterns. An interesting follow-up question, then, concerns whether the observed cultural group differences in patterns of relating to strangers following social exclusion extend to other types of interactions with all kinds of strangers. For example, would herders be more likely to help strangers, cooperate, and avoid conflict with them to a greater extent? What implications would the currently observed relationship patterns have for psychological phenomena such as intergroup conflict, attitudes toward immigrants, and generalized prosocial tendencies? Future research exploring these questions could highlight the role of economic activity in broader social and political domains.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">One might wonder whether our findings may be unique to the presently studied groups. We do not mean to suggest that the present findings would generalize to all farmers and all herders. Farming and herding communities elsewhere in the world may require different levels of commercialism, competition, and interaction with strangers for economic survival, which may lead to different responses to ostracism by strangers. Rather, we wish to argue that when a particular group is important to individuals’ livelihood within a culture, then ostracism by that group will be more painful and will be responded to in different ways than when that group is less important. Thus, we suspect that findings would generalize to other groups that vary in their interactions with, and reliance on, strangers. Take, for example, individuals who are high in residential mobility or relational mobility. Individuals with high residential mobility (i.e., those moving from one location to another) are likely to have “duty-free” friendships and group memberships (as opposed to obligatory friendships and group memberships) (for a review, see 
          Oishi, 2010) and those high in relational mobility (i.e., those having greater options in a given society regarding interpersonal relationships and social groups) would have more opportunities to acquire new, maintain current, and leave old relationships and memberships (for a review, see 
          Yuki &amp; Schug, 2012). Individuals with high residential or relational mobility would be expected to interact with strangers because they relocate to new places or because they feel freer to leave old friendships and establish new ones with people they do not know well. Similarly, individuals who have to interact with others unknown to them as part of their work responsibilities (residentially or relationally mobile or not) would also be expected to show similar patterns of responses as herders studied in this research. Future research is needed to test the generalizability of the present findings among individuals who show similar characteristics to the economic activity pursued by herders in this research.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">A further interesting question for future research concerns whether there would be any cultural differences in immediate responses to ostracism. Previous research has suggested that individuals’ immediate responses to ostracism are less susceptible to moderating variables than their more reflective responses (see 
          Williams, 2007, for a review). This point has been supported by recent work with Chinese participants by 
          Ren, Wesselmann, and Williams (2013), who showed that interdependent self-construal facilitated recovery from some of ostracism’s negative effects, but did not moderate the initial pain. Culture comparative work is needed to further investigate the potential differences in immediate responses to ostracism and recovery from it in the reflective stage.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Finally, how can we reconcile the present findings with the findings from research on culture and honor that demonstrate herders showing vigilance and acting aggressively in response to threats to their honor (e.g., 
          Cohen &amp; Nisbett, 1994; 
          Daly &amp; Wilson, 1988; 
          Nisbett &amp; Cohen, 1996)?
          <a id="b-fn15"> </a><sup /> In line with the literature on culture of honor, the present studies demonstrate that herders take slights by strangers more seriously than do farmers. However, they do not show aggressive responses to these slights; on the contrary, they tend to respond in an affiliative manner. Several explanations may underlie this discrepancy. First, members of many honor cultures endorse strong politeness norms because of the potentially severe costs associated with violence erupting out of hostility and anger (see 
          Cohen &amp; Vandello, 2004; 
          Cohen, Vandello, Puente, &amp; Rantilla, 1999; 
          Cross, Uskul, Gercek-Swing, Alözkan, &amp; Ataca, 2013). It is possible that herders in the present studies might have acted out of politeness norms that restricted initial conflict. A second explanation is methodological. It is possible that the scenarios used in the present studies (Studies 3, 4, and 5) did not provide an easy platform for honor-related aggression to erupt (e.g., being 
          <em>excluded</em> [and not insulted] by a 
          <em>group</em> of individuals at a bus stop). Thus, the situations used here are more likely to tap the first category of situations generated by participants in Study 1 in response to the question: What is the most effective way of ostracizing someone? that referred to refusals to interact with someone. If the situations were to tap the responses given in the second category of situations generated in Study 1 that referred to engaging in actions to make someone bad, such as slandering or offending (see 
          Kerr &amp; Levine, 2008, who refer to such actions as examples of effective social exclusion strategies), the responses may have taken a different form and resemble more those reported in the culture of honor literature. In fact, this second category of situations show similarities to those generated by Turkish participants in another study as examples of behaviors that could be used to stain others’ honor (see 
          Uskul, Cross, Gercek-Swing, Sunbay, &amp; Ataca, 2012). Further research is needed to explore whether different types of social exclusion acts lead to different psychological responses among farmers and herders for whom strangers matter to a different degree.
        </p><a id="psp-106-5-752-EBADA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Taking a Cultural Approach to the Study of Ostracism</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Although our research questions were based on and inspired by research on social exclusion conducted almost exclusively with members of Western societies, our approach was not to treat the studied region as a setting to simply test the replicability of previously observed findings in the literature. Our focus on the sociocultural/economic settings allowed us to generate predictions that were based on the everyday realities of the groups examined in the present research. We also carefully considered and pilot-tested the methods that we thought would be meaningful to the members of the studied communities and made sure that we established conceptual equivalence before conducting our studies designed to investigate responses to social exclusion. Moreover, we used a variety of methods to collect responses (open-ended responses; [Studies 1 and 4], self-report on Likert scales [Studies 2 and 3], forced choice [Study 5]) not to have our results be affected by a particular choice of a data collection method and not to systematically subject our findings to problems associated with cross-cultural measurement.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Focusing on everyday economic realities of farmers and herders, we were also able to uncover novel evidence that is supportive of the model by 
          Smart Richman and Leary (2009) proposed to understand the factors that determine the kinds of actions individuals take in the wake of rejection. Specifically, the present findings suggest that the value of relationship with strangers and the perceived cost of exclusion by them are likely to shape actions of herders whose livelihood depends heavily on their positive interactions with strangers.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Finally, by focusing on the amount of time spent with strangers in Study 5 as a potential mediating factor accounting for group differences observed in the recommended responses to naïve others following an ostracism event, we tested the role played by the everyday realities of farmers and herders in their interpersonal relationships. This approach emphasizes the role of practices afforded by economic systems in norms concerning how one should behave in certain situations and helps us bridge the psychological with the external circumstances acknowledging that culture also exists outside of individuals’ head (
          Cohen, 2007; 
          Markus &amp; Hamedani, 2007).
        </p><a id="psp-106-5-752-EAADA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Concluding Comments</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The present research demonstrates the moderating role of cultural background and source of ostracism in ostracism-related experiences. By working with farming and herding communities in the eastern Black Sea Region of Turkey, we were able to capitalize on the existence of a difference in reliance on distant others for economic reasons while being able to hold constant potentially confounding sociocultural variables such as national identity, language, ethnicity, and religion. Rather than emphasizing internally held variables such as attitudes or values, we focused directly on the everyday realities afforded by sociocultural/economic settings that provide the material basis of psychological outcomes (
          Markus &amp; Hamedani, 2007). This way, our work provides evidence on the role of external practices that remain largely unexamined in conventional psychological theory and research and contributes to previous research in which a cultural-ecological (e.g., 
          Adams et al., 2012; 
          Berry, 1979; Keller, 2011; 
          Whiting &amp; Edwards, 1988) or sociocultural (e.g., 
          Adams, 2005; 
          Maynard &amp; Greenfield, 2003; 
          Plaut, Markus, &amp; Lachman, 2002) approach has been used. In doing so, it helps bridge the psychological with external circumstances (
          Cohen, 2007; 
          Markus &amp; Hamedani, 2007) and allows us to situate the ways in which the characters from our introduction, Mahmut and Kahraman, relate to others within their everyday worlds.

A final reason for deciding against using the cyberball paradigm in these communities was that the use of deception would be very difficult to explain, even with a careful debriefing. We have established trust-based relationships with the members of these communities, and we suspected that use of deception might jeopardize these relationships.
