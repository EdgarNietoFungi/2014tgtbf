A working model of situation perception implies the existence of taxonomizable dimensions of psychologically meaningful, important, and consequential situation characteristics tied to situation cues, goal affordances, and behavior. Such dimensions are developed and demonstrated in a multi-method set of 6 studies. First, the “Situational Eight DIAMONDS” dimensions Duty, Intellect, Adversity, Mating, pOsitivity, Negativity, Deception, and Sociality (Study 1) are established from the Riverside Situational Q-Sort (Sherman, Nave, &amp; Funder, 2010, 2012, 2013; Wagerman &amp; Funder, 2009). Second, their rater agreement (Study 2) and associations with situation cues and goal/trait affordances (Studies 3 and 4) are examined. Finally, the usefulness of these dimensions is demonstrated by examining their predictive power of behavior (Study 5), particularly vis-à-vis measures of personality and situations (Study 6). Together, we provide extensive and compelling evidence that the DIAMONDS taxonomy is useful for organizing major dimensions of situation characteristics. We discuss the DIAMONDS taxonomy in the context of previous taxonomic approaches and sketch future research directions.

        </blockquote></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Which characteristics of situations are psychologically important? Can these characteristics be organized into major dimensions? Psychological research has paid surprisingly little attention to these questions. Instead, research has traditionally focused on the psychologically important characteristics of persons, with the result of several widely accepted taxonomies (e.g., Big Five: 
        Goldberg, 1990; 
        John &amp; Srivastava, 1999; Big Six: 
        Lee &amp; Ashton, 2004; Big Seven: 
        Tellegen &amp; Waller, 1987). By comparison, the characterization of situations has been sparsely studied and not unified—a state of affairs that has been widely lamented (e.g., 
        Argyle, Furnham, &amp; Graham, 1981; 
        Edwards &amp; Templeton, 2005; 
        Endler, 1993;

        Yang, Read, &amp; Miller, 2006, 
        2009). These researchers and others agree that a synthesized psychology of situations is needed to complement, enrich, and spur forward the relatively advanced psychology of personality so that persons thinking, feeling, and acting 
        <em>in situ</em> can be studied (
        Benet-Martínez et al., in press; 
        Funder, 2001, 
        2006, 
        2007, 
        2008, 
        2009).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Situation research faces three key issues: definition, taxonomization, and measurement. 
        Hogan (2009) concluded that “the conceptual status of “situations” is a mess, . . . there is little agreement about how to define situations, there is no widely accepted taxonomy of situations, and [we] have no idea how to measure them in a standardized manner” (p. 249). The present work tackles these three issues by offering a perspective that defines situations in terms of specific characteristics, proposes a taxonomy of psychologically meaningful dimensions of situation characteristics, and provides a psychometric tool for measuring these dimensions.
      </p><a id="psp-107-4-677-EMDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_8" title="The Psychology of Situations">The Psychology of Situations</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Personality research has traditionally focused on the manifestation of individual differences in behavior, whereas social psychological research has focused on how experimentally manipulated stimuli evoke responses averaged across individuals. Thus, in effect, personality psychology sought to explain behavior by personality, and social psychology by situations (
        Funder, 2001; 
        Funder &amp; Ozer, 1983; 
        Ross &amp; Nisbett, 1991; 
        Reis, 2008). These contrasting perspectives led to the “person–situation debate” (
        Fleeson &amp; Noftle, 2008a; 
        Kenrick &amp; Funder, 1988; 
        Mischel, 1968, 
        2009; 
        Bem, 1983; 
        Bem &amp; Funder, 1978). Today, this debate is largely over (
        Fleeson &amp; Noftle, 2008a; 
        Mischel, 2009) and, some would argue, was futile in the first place (
        Hogan, 2009; 
        Rotter, 1981). It has been supplanted by research on dynamic person–environment transactions, which bridge the divide between personality and social psychology (e.g., 
        Cramer et al., 2012; 
        Fleeson, 2001, 
        2007; 
        Fleeson &amp; Noftle, 2008b; 
        Funder, 2006, 
        2008, 
        2009; 
        Mischel &amp; Shoda, 1995, 
        1999; 
        Read et al., 2010).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The significance of person–environment transactions was recognized very early by 
        Lewin (1936, 
        1943, 
        1946, 
        1951) who coined the famous (and remodeled) formula 
        <em>B</em> = f(
        <em>P</em>, 
        <em>S</em>), where behavior 
        <em>B</em> is a function of both the person 
        <em>P</em> and his or her situation 
        <em>S</em>. Thus, the person, situation, and behavior form an inextricably interwoven triad (
        Funder, 2001, 
        2006, 
        2008, 
        2009; 
        Wagerman &amp; Funder, 2009). Regarding 
        <em>P</em>, the study of personality is prolific, sophisticated, and advanced in theory and methods (
        Funder, 2001). Regarding 
        <em>B</em>, researchers have emphasized the importance of studying behavior (
        Baumeister, Vohs, &amp; Funder, 2007), which is now gaining momentum (
        Furr, 2009). Regarding 
        <em>S</em>, however, explicit psychological research on situations still seems to be neglected despite situations sometimes being proclaimed as all-important (
        Ross &amp; Nisbett, 1991). This state of affairs is troublesome because persons and behavior cannot be fully understood if situations cannot be described, measured, and taxonomized (
        Wagerman &amp; Funder, 2009). After all, all action, cognition, motivation, and emotion is embedded in context: A person always navigates 
        <em>in situ</em> (
        Block &amp; Block, 1981). A thorough understanding of situations will thus ultimately aid the explanation, prediction, and understanding of personality and behavior (
        Magnusson, 1981b).

        Asendorpf, 2009; 
        Hogan, 2009; 
        Magnusson, 1981b; 
        Reis, 2008). Despite its frequent usage in lay language (“We have a situation here!”) and scientific parlance (“Situations determine behavior”), the term is an elusive panchreston. Situations have been defined in terms of physical environments (e.g., 
        Craik, 1981), descriptive nouns (e.g., 
        Van Heck, 1984, 
        1989), appraisals and attributions (e.g., 
        Edwards &amp; Templeton, 2005), affect (e.g., 
        Russell, Ward, &amp; Pratt, 1981), goals (e.g., 
        Argyle et al., 1981; 
        Yang et al., 2006, 
        2009), activities (e.g., 
        Pervin, 1978), and other persons’ behaviors (
        Fournier, Moskowitz, &amp; Zuroff, 2008, 
        2009). As the term is ridden with complex ontological and epistemic considerations, it is beyond the scope of this work to provide a conclusive and ultimate definition. The present approach is more modest: We propose a 
        <em>working definition</em> that enables the study of psychologically important characteristics of situations.

        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Figure 1 illustrates our working model of situation perception. It distinguishes between five major components (captured in numbered boxes): (1) situation cues, (2) concurrent information processing, (3) person aspects, (4) situation characteristics, and (5) behavior. Different paths (a, a′, b, c, d) connect these factors to each other. 
          <em>Situation cues</em> (Box 1) are physical or objective elements that comprise the environment. They can be objectively measured and quantified. Cues include (a) persons and interactions (Who?); (b) objects, events, and activities (What?); and (c) spatial location (Where?) (
          Mehl &amp; Robbins, 2012; 
          Pervin, 1978; 
          Saucier et al., 2007). Such cues form a constellation or setting (
          Pervin, 1978) or ecology (
          Brunswik, 1952, 
          1956), but they do not mean or convey anything per se. They derive ultimately from raw sensory information that has been described as physico-biological (
          Block &amp; Block, 1981) or environmental (
          Saucier et al., 2007), and also include structures of basic events (e.g., games, parties) and settings (e.g., workplace).

          Nystedt, 1981; 
          Wicker, 1992). Psychological situations—unlike persons who are identifiably stable entities in time and space—have no clear demarcations, vary dynamically, do not exist without at least one person to perceive them, and cannot rate themselves. Nonetheless, people form impressions of situations as if they were real, coherent entities (
          Cantor et al., 1982; 
          Champagne &amp; Pervin, 1987; 
          Craik, 1971;

          Quattrone, 1982; 
          Sherman et al., 2012, 
          2013). Forming situation impressions serves adaptive purposes of better navigating through the world by being able to predict what will happen and coordinating behavior accordingly (
          Edwards &amp; Templeton, 2005). As it would be extremely inefficient, costly, and time-consuming to process every possible raw situation cue, our perceptual system evolved to quickly attend to, filter, and interpret salient, important, and consequential information (
          Miller, 2007). In this vein, 
          Edwards and Templeton (2005) proposed that “people see situations as having underlying qualities akin to human personality traits” (p. 706). Thus, psychological situations are perceived on 
          <em>situation characteristics</em> (see 
          Pervin, 1981, p. 346) which describe situations similar to the manner in which people can be described with traits, attributes, or qualities (
          de Raad, 2004, pp. 186/187; 
          Edwards &amp; Templeton, 2005). Situation characteristics people ascribe to situations can denote attributions of some underlying causal power or quality (
          de Raad, 2004; 
          Edwards &amp; Templeton, 2005; 
          Harré &amp; Madden, 1975; 
          White, 1989). Thus, situation characteristics essentially capture psychologically salient and important meanings (see 
          Magnusson &amp; Endler, 1977, p. 4).
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">How a situation is perceived will determine which 
          <em>behaviors and actions</em> (Box 5) are taken (Path c). As 
          Endler (1981, p. 364, italics in original) states, “actual behavior occurs in a 
          <em>situation</em>, or the aspect of the ecology that a person perceives and reacts to immediately” (see also 
          Murray, 1938, p. 40 and 
          Lewin, 1936, p. 217). Behavior may then impact the cues in the objective environmental setting in different ways (Path d). These links between behavior and cues have also been labeled person–environment transactions (e.g., 
          Buss, 1987): Based on his or her situation perception, a person may select, evoke, generate, or modulate certain cues within his or her environment (i.e., socio-ecological niche).

        Ten Berge &amp; de Raad, 1999 and 
        Yang et al., 2009 for excellent reviews). These have taxonomized three different kinds of situational information (in descending order of abstraction): classes (“Which kinds of situations are there?”), characteristics (“Which attributes can be used to describe situations?”), and cues (“Of which elements are situations constituted?”). In this work, we do not focus on the taxonomization of classes (i.e., groups, types, categories, clusters; e.g., “social situations,” “work situations,” etc.) or cues (i.e., elements, components; e.g., persons, places, objects, etc.), but on the taxonomization of 
        <em>psychologically important characteristics</em> of situations (i.e., features, attributes, qualities, properties, descriptors; e.g., “terrible,” “pleasant”). 
        Table 1 gives an overview of 21 extant situational taxonomies, their situation domains, and which situational information (classes vs. characteristics vs. cues) they have taxonomized.
        
<br /><br /><a id="tbl1"> </a><span class="centered"><img class="rs_skip" src="http://largecontent.ebsco-content.com/embimages/6059cb20fbb9a310a92ab8618ff46667/5422c6da/pdh/psp/psp-107-4-677-tbl1a.gif" alt="psp-107-4-677-tbl1a.gif" title="Overview of Extant Situational Taxonomies" /><em>Overview of Extant Situational Taxonomies</em></span></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">None of the taxonomies listed in 
        Table 1 have achieved widespread acceptance, perhaps because they differ from each other in key respects (
        Rauthmann, 2014; 
        Yang et al., 2009) and are bedeviled by different problems. First, the taxonomies are based on a variety of underlying meta-theories, theoretical perspectives, and situation concepts that do not lend themselves to be compared and integrated easily (see 
        Ten Berge &amp; de Raad, 1999, Table 1, p. 355).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Second, the taxonomies have addressed different kinds of situational information. As can be seen in 
        Table 1, from the 21 taxonomies listed, 16 pertained to situation classes, 12 to situation characteristics, and 1 to situation cues. Importantly, though, most of these taxonomies only capture situation characteristics secondarily via inference or as a means of concretizing situation classes. Often, the underlying characteristic tying together several different situations is merely inferred by the fact that the situations are perceived as similar (see, e.g., 
        Magnusson, 1971). Thus, if the situations “encountering a tiger,” “going to the dentist,” and “having your paper rejected” are perceived as similar, they will likely obtain a label such as “negative situations” (a class) and be marked 
        <em>post hoc</em> with the attribute “negative” (a characteristic). However, this is problematic because it has not been established why, or on which dimensions, the persons have perceived the situations as similar. Indeed, participants did not actually rate any characteristics of the situations. In effect, entire situations are taxonomized in most approaches, and situation characteristics, if at all, merely inferred from the situation class.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Third, inconsistently used language (e.g., the term “feature” pertains to cues 
        <em>and</em> characteristics in the literature) and lacking discrimination between the concepts of classes, characteristics, and cues can obscure what has been taxonomized (i.e., input) or what is the result of the taxonomy (i.e., output). Further, two different problems arise: the jingle fallacy (i.e., labeling two different things the same) and the jangle fallacy (i.e., labeling similar or identical things differently). As a result of these complications, no clear and common language has emerged for situational taxonomies so far, impeding comparisons between taxonomies.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Fourth, different procedures have been used to derive pools of situation variables (e.g., generation by researchers vs. daily diary by laypeople vs. lexical approach). However, most taxonomies have 
        <em>a priori</em> restricted domains of situations. As can be seen in 
        Table 1, this is particularly true for social/interpersonal situations which have been given the most interest. However, not all situations are social/interpersonal in nature; thus, many and potentially important situations may be missing. Moreover, many taxonomies rely on a very limited set of situations or situation characteristics. Indeed, 
        Yang et al. (2009) summarized in their review on situational taxonomies that “the numbers of situations 
        <em>sampled</em> ranged from 12 to 36, and the numbers of features [characteristics and cues] of situations ranged from 9 to 38” (p. 1025, italics added for emphasis). The problem is that, at the beginning of taxonomic investigations, already highly restricted 
        <em>ad hoc</em> samples of situations or characteristics were used. Typically, however, one would expect a broader base to draw from in order to establish a taxonomy.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Fifth, situation variables have been judged by different raters (e.g., lay people from a community sample vs. experts vs. college students) on different criteria (e.g., frequency of occurrence vs. behaviors in the situation vs. normativeness/appropriateness of behavior/trait expression vs. similarity of situations). However, most studies did not utilize sufficiently large sample sizes for factor-analytical approaches or replicated findings across different samples.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Sixth, contingent upon on the nature of the input variables and research questions, different methods have been used to analyze situational data (e.g., factor analysis, cluster analysis, multidimensional scaling). All approaches cluster together situational information by some criterion, but the resultant findings may not be compared easily to each other.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Lastly, a major limitation to virtually any situational taxonomy presented so far concerns their usefulness. 
        Yang et al. (2006, p. 755) concluded that there is “no consensus . . . on which taxonomy has demonstrated the most conceptual and practical usefulness to our understanding of situations.” This may be traced back to two problems. First, the different factors outlined above have contributed to too much diversity. As a consequence, researchers may be unsure which taxonomy to use (if they are aware of them at all). Second, traditionally less value has been assigned to deriving a psychometrically sound tool accompanying the taxonomy. To the best of our knowledge, no taxonomy has so far produced a validated, standardized measurement tool.

        <em>psychological characteristics of situations</em> can be organized. This research endeavor is unique: As explained above, other taxonomies do not directly compete with our goal to derive major dimensions of situation characteristics as they concern primarily situation classes. Those taxonomies that do make inferences about or concern situation characteristics either suffer from methodological problems (e.g., small sample sizes), are confined to only one domain of situations (mostly social/interpersonal situations), have not been used in any other research, and/or did not provide psychometrically validated scales that could be used to assess the proposed dimensions. Our work should move us further toward a 
        <em>clear</em> and 
        <em>common</em> language in research on situation characteristics and additionally provide a measurement instrument. Researchers can then assess and study specified, broad, and agreed upon domains of situation characteristics.

As previously noted, situational taxonomies have not produced any inventories or scales that could be used to assess their proposed dimensions. As a result, most researchers need to resort to self-constructed and unvalidated measurement tools (e.g., 
        Argyle et al., 1981; 
        Fleeson, 2007). Recently, however, the Riverside Situational Q-Sort (RSQ) has been introduced (
        Sherman et al., 2010, 
        2012, 
        2013; 
        Wagerman &amp; Funder, 2009). So far, it is the only available measure that samples characteristics of situations in a fairly comprehensive way. It was the final instrument developed to assess the full Person–Situation–Behavior Triad: The California Adult Q-Sort (CAQ; 
        Block, 1961/1978) assesses personality, and the Riverside Behavioral Q-Sort (RBQ; 
        Funder, Furr, &amp; Colvin, 2000) assesses behaviors.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The RSQ was originally conceived as a Q-technique tool in which items are sorted into a peaked, quasi-normal distribution (
        Block, 1961/1978). This fixed distribution format ranges conventionally across nine slots, ranging from “highly uncharacteristic of the situation” to “highly characteristic of the situation.” Readers interested in the strengths and limitations of Q-sorting techniques are referred to 
        Block (1961/1978, 
        2008). As there may be some limitations to Q-sorts under certain circumstances (for details, see 
        Kampen &amp; Tamás, 2013; cf. 
        Brown, Danielson, &amp; van Exel, 2014), most researchers may prefer Likert-type ratings which are also generally more economical and less time-consuming. This work will thus make use of both Q-sort and Likert-versions of the RSQ.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The originally published version of the RSQ with 81 items was based on the 100-item CAQ that comprehensively samples personality characteristics, many of which go beyond the usual Big Five (
        Block, 2010). Specifically, RSQ items were written to describe contexts in which personality characteristics described by CAQ items might be expected to emerge (
        Wagerman &amp; Funder, 2009). For example, the CAQ item “appears to have a high degree of intellectual capacity” yielded the RSQ item “affords an opportunity to demonstrate intellectual capacity.” The RSQ was not based on any explicit theory about which characteristics a situation should have (because there simply is no theory and any theory would likely have 
        <em>a priori</em> restricted the scope of characteristics), but its item content was devised to be as inclusive and comprehensive as possible. Indeed, the application of the RSQ to “as wide a range of situations as possible” was one of 
        <em>the</em> guiding principles for its development (see 
        Sherman et al., 2010, p. 332). The original RSQ Version 1.0 had exactly 100 items (i.e., one for each CAQ item), but some items did not make sense to readers, seemed redundant, and/or showed little to no variance. Revisions resulted in the RSQ Version 2.0 with 81 items which is detailed in 
        Wagerman and Funder (2009) and 
        Sherman et al. (2010). Some items have then been further slightly rephrased and refined (e.g., avoiding double-barreled items by forming two items), and some new items were added to broaden the scope. This resulted in the 88-item RSQ 3.0. The newest RSQ Version 3.15 with 89 items
        <a id="b-fn3"> </a><sup /> that broadly sample a variety of situation characteristics can be found in the online supplemental materials, Section A (OSM A).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The RSQ has already shown itself to be useful in a variety of empirical applications despite its short history. One early study using the RSQ found that the situations experienced over time by a given participant tend to be described more similarly to each other than to situations experienced by other participants (
        Sherman et al., 2010). Moreover, behavior tends to be more consistent across situations described more similarly on the RSQ. A further study using the RSQ explored implications of the degree to which one’s personality matches or is “congruent” with one’s behavior in particular situations (
        Sherman et al., 2012). Other studies found that construing situational stimuli “distinctively” (i.e., differently from most other observers) is associated with personality (
        Todd &amp; Funder, 2012; 
        Serfass &amp; Sherman, 2013; 
        Sherman et al., 2013). Additionally, the RSQ has been used to construct and utilize prototypical templates of situations suggested by aspects of evolutionary theory (allowing behavioral predictions to be empirically tested: 
        Morse, Neel, Todd, &amp; Funder, 2014) and has already been employed in cross-cultural research (
        Funder, Guillaume, Kumagai, Kawamoto, &amp; Sato, 2012).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Despite its demonstrated usefulness, the 89 items of the RSQ make it a lengthy instrument that can be cumbersome in some research contexts. Moreover, it would be conceptually desirable to reduce these items to a more succinct and perhaps fundamental list of core characteristics of situations. In the present research, we thus sought to examine the factorial structure of the RSQ, extract and identify major dimensions, and propose a psychometrically sound yet economically short version of the RSQ tailored to these major dimensions.</p><a id="psp-107-4-677-EIDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_39" title="The Current Work">The Current Work</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">It was our goal to establish a framework that should move us one step further toward a unified language in research on psychological characteristics of situations.

Our working model of situation perception (see 
        Figure 1) and Ekehammar’s research areas served as organizational frameworks for a set of six studies. In Study 1, we establish and describe major, meaningful, important, and consequential dimensions of situation characteristics (Area 1). In Study 2, we examine to what extent people agree in these dimensions when judging situations (Area 1). In Studies 3 and 4, we investigate the nomological networks of these dimensions by tying them to manifest situation cues (Area 2) and a variety of situational affordances (Area 3). Lastly in Studies 5 and 6, we demonstrate the usefulness and predictive power of these dimensions by having them predict behavior (Areas 4 and 5), especially vis-à-vis other measures of personality traits and situations.

          Table 1), we could identify several major dimensions that were consistently found across different situation pools, judgment criteria, samples, and data-analytical methods (see 
          Ten Berge &amp; de Raad, 1999; 
          de Raad, 2004; 
          Yang et al., 2009). Interestingly, these dimensions all had corresponding dimensions in personality trait taxonomies, specifically from the Big Five (Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness/Intellect/Culture, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness; 
          Costa &amp; McCrae, 1992; 
          Digman, 1990; 
          Goldberg, 1990; 
          John &amp; Srivastava, 1999) and Big Seven (Big Five plus Positive Valence and Negative Valence; 
          Benet &amp; Waller, 1995; 
          Benet-Martínez &amp; Waller, 1997; 
          Saucier, 1997; 
          Tellegen &amp; Waller, 1987; 
          Waller 1999). This suggested that situation and personality trait taxonomies may share similar 
          <em>content</em>.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">First, there were “valence” factors as Positivity and Negativity of a situation (e.g., 
          Edwards &amp; Templeton, 2005; 
          Forgas, 1976; 
          King &amp; Sorrentino, 1983; 
          Magnusson, 1971; 
          Ten Berge &amp; de Raad, 2002). These factors appear to be distinct and do not exist on one continuum (positive vs. negative), as a situation may harbor both pleasant and unpleasant aspects simultaneously (
          Edwards &amp; Templeton, 2005). In terms of personality trait content, these dimensions closely resemble Positive Valence and Extraversion (Positive Affect) versus Negative Valence and Neuroticism (Negative Affect). Second, there were factors of recreation, play, and cultural affairs (e.g., 
          Eckes, 1995; 
          King &amp; Sorrentino, 1983; 
          Pervin, 1976; 
          Ten Berge &amp; de Raad, 2001). In terms of personality trait content, these factors resemble Extraversion and Openness/Intellect/Culture. Third, there were factors pertaining to different aspects of social/interpersonal affairs (
          Argyle et al., 1981; 
          Battistich &amp; Thompson, 1980; 
          Eckes, 1995; 
          Forgas, 1976;

          Pervin, 1976; 
          Ten Berge &amp; de Raad, 2001). In terms of personality trait content, these factors closely resemble Agreeableness and Extraversion. Fourth, there were factors of working, goal-pursuit, productivity, and achievement (e.g., 
          Edwards &amp; Templeton, 2005; 
          Eckes, 1995; 
          Hacker, 1981;

          Nascimento-Schulze, 1981; 
          Pervin, 1976; 
          Yang et al., 2006). In terms of personality trait content, these factors resemble Conscientiousness. It is noteworthy that content capturing Honesty/Humility from the Big Six HEXACO Model (
          Lee &amp; Ashton, 2004, 
          2008; 
          Ashton &amp; Lee, 2007,

        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Why does similar content show up in situation and personality taxonomies? Situation perception may, at least partly, be governed by the same or similar cognitive and affective judgment processes as in person perception (see 
          Nystedt, 1972a, 
          1972b, 
          1981). This notion is supported by ample research that has demonstrated that people pervasively and automatically form perceptions of situations as if they were real entities (
          Cantor et al., 1982; 
          Champagne &amp; Pervin, 1987; 
          Duff &amp; Newman, 1997; 
          Edwards &amp; Templeton, 2005; 
          Forgas, 1976; 
          Krull &amp; Dill, 1996; 
          Lupfer et al., 1990;

          1981; 
          Rauthmann, 2012; 
          Quattrone, 1982). Thus, content dimensions encapsulated in taxonomies of personality traits or how we perceive persons (
          Srivastava, 2010) may also show up in perceptions of situations (
          de Raad, 2004; 
          Edwards &amp; Templeton, 2005; 
          Ten Berge &amp; de Raad, 1999,

For example, the item “affords an opportunity to demonstrate intellectual capacity” taps the content domain of Openness/Intellect. Each RSQ item could tap multiple content domains at once. All 89 items from the RSQ 3.15 are listed in OSM A, along with the content analysis of what the items primarily tap. As can be seen there, 3.37% of items tapped content of Positive Valence, 17.98% of Negative Valence, 17.98% of Neuroticism, 10.11% of Extraversion, 13.48% of Openness/Intellect, 23.60% of Agreeableness, 10.11% of Conscientiousness, 5.62% of Honesty/Humility, and 32.58% of “Other/Unspecified.” It is noteworthy that 32.58% of items could 
          <em>not</em> be accounted for by traditional personality domains. These findings allude to the inclusiveness and broad content coverage of the RSQ.

            R Development Core Team, 2013) using different factor-analytical procedures varying in extraction and rotation methods. As recommended in 
            Gorsuch (1983/2008, pp. 170–171), we employed both mathematical approaches (e.g., parallel analysis) and subjective approaches (e.g., inspection of different factor structures) to determine the optimal number of factors because mathematical approaches alone tend to overestimate non-trivial factors when many items (as in the RSQ) are factor-analyzed. We ultimately only retained dimensions that were (a) relatively stable across different data-analytical procedures, (b) neither under- nor over-extracted (as judged by mathematical and conceptual criteria), (c) non-trivial (i.e., many and strong primary loadings, coupled with low secondary loadings), and (d) well interpretable and conceptually sensible.

            <em>M</em> = 0 and

            <em>M</em> = 0 and

This transformation adjusted for different mean levels and variances to control for sample-specific response patterns due to different administration techniques (e.g., Q-Sort and Likert-ratings on a 9-point scale vs. Likert-ratings on a 4-point scale) and cultures (Austria, India, Germany, Spain, United States). Third, we aggregated the seven individual data sets into one final pooled data set on which we ran analyses.

            Revelle, 2013). For different factor-analytic methods (extraction methods: principal components analysis vs. principal axis factoring vs. minimum residual; rotation methods: varimax vs. promax), the number of factors ranged from 3 to 17: 3 or 4 (Very Simple Structure Complexity 1 and 2), 6 (Velicer’s MAP criterion), 6 to 9 (scree-plot inspection), and 15 to 17 (parallel analysis). Next, by carefully comparing solutions up to 17 factors in different factor analyses, we ultimately settled for an eight-factor solution. Eight factors were particularly favored when inspecting the bass-ackwards findings (see below; 
            Goldberg, 2006; 
            Waller, 2007). We gave the eight extracted dimensions following labels: 
            <em>Duty</em> (e.g., A job needs to be done), 
            <em>Intellect</em> (e.g., Situation affords an opportunity to demonstrate intellectual capacity), 
            <em>Adversity</em> (e.g., Being blamed for something), 
            <em>Mating</em> (e.g., Potential romantic partners are present), 
            <em>pOsitivity</em> (e.g., Situation is potentially enjoyable), 
            <em>Negativity</em> (e.g., Situation is potentially anxiety-inducing), 
            <em>Deception</em> (e.g., It is possible to deceive someone), and 
            <em>Sociality</em> (e.g., Social interaction is possible). We henceforward refer to these major dimensions of situation characteristics as the “Situational Eight DIAMONDS.”

            Magnusson, 1981b; 
            Rommetveit, 1981), ambiguous or “complex” situations (e.g., those containing both positive and negative qualities, such as reading a typical review of one’s paper) may not be described adequately. Going down the hierarchy, specific, differentiated dimensions may operate on an abstraction level comparable to facets of the Big Five (e.g., within the NEO-PI-R).

            Figure 2). First, factor structures were generally “messier” beyond the DIAMONDS dimensions. Primary loadings of items decreased, whereas secondary loadings increased. This resulted in more trivial factors with only one or two major factor loadings. Second, some factors were unclear (see “???” in 
            Figure 2) because the top loading items either did not form a clearly interpretable factor or there were too few majorly loading items. This occurred from the ninth level onwards multiple times (see 
            Figure 2). Third, factors beyond the eight-factor level broke up into facets predominantly driven by few items with similar wording or semantic content. Lastly, factors beneath the eight-factor level could all be subsumed and adequately captured by super-ordinate factors at a higher level of abstraction, specifically the DIAMONDS dimensions. Indeed, any factor that emerged below the eight-factor level could be deemed a facet of the DIAMONDS dimensions. Taken together, an eight-factor solution represented a good trade-off between parsimony (with few abstract dimensions of broad bandwidth) and highly content-specific facets (with narrow dimensions of higher fidelity).

This analysis yielded bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals of factor loadings. If these confidence intervals did not contain 0, then factor loadings could be deemed as “statistically significant.” The full factor loading matrix is presented in the online supplemental materials, Section B (OSM B). We then inspected those RSQ items that loaded the highest, significantly, and in one key direction onto each DIAMONDS dimension. Findings are summarized in

We also examined to what extent DIAMONDS perceptions were associated with basic socio-demographic variables. There were only few and inconsistent associations with sex or age across all samples.

Some of these dimensions have already been partially described in extant literature, but not in any systematic way or integrated within a larger set of dimensions. Further, it is striking that the DIAMONDS dimensions have content-counterparts in person perception. Specifically, Duty can be tied to Conscientiousness, Intellect to Openness/Intellect, pOsitivity to Positive Valence and Extraversion, Negativity to Negative Valence and Neuroticism, Deception to (the inverses of) Agreeableness and Honesty/Humility, and Sociality to Extraversion and Agreeableness. Only the content of the dimensions Adversity and Mating is not clearly encapsulated in personality trait taxonomies.

People in a given socio-culture form shared mental situation models, schemata, or scripts about circumscribed situational episodes (see 
          Krahé, 1990) such as “drinking with friends in a bar” or “writing a research paper.” As such, they should possess shared meaning systems (
          Kenny, 1994, 
          2004) so that situations are to some degree perceived, described, and evaluated similarly across persons (canonico-consensual perception; 
          Block &amp; Block, 1981). From an evolutionary perspective, the correct perception of “reality” (contributing to canonico-consensual perceptions) has obvious adaptive value: perceiving situations as most other people do should have served adaptive purposes in human phylogenesis (e.g., precise movements in the environment, smooth communication, group coordination, etc.). For example, almost all people would perceive encountering a tiger as a threatening situation; not perceiving such a situation as threatening (and thus not initiating flight) might have unfortunate consequences. To summarize, characteristics of the psychological situation may gain a social reality by being uniformly, or almost uniformly, perceived. This means that we can expect a substantive amount of 
          <em>agreement</em> in situation ratings (see 
          Sherman et al., 2013).

What was going on? What were you doing? Where were you?” Participants then rated their situations on the RSQ 3.00 with a 9-point Likert-type scale (0 = 
            <em>does not apply at all</em>, 8 = 
            <em>totally applies</em>). Participants also provided other data, such as personality and behavior in the situation (to be used in Studies 4–6).

            <em>N</em> = 204 U.S. American university students during five laboratory visits over 5 weeks (with visits being at least 48 hr apart). Out of these, complete data from

            <em>M</em> = 19.62 years,

On the first visit, participants obtained information on the study, provided informed consent, and filled out personality questionnaires. On the subsequent visits (Waves 1–4), participants wrote a brief description of the situation they had experienced the day before at either 10 a.m., 2 p.m., 5 p.m., or 9 p.m. A Latin-square design was used so that approximately one fourth of participants completed the study using one of the following time sequences: 10 a.m.–2 p.m.–5 p.m.–9 p.m.; 2 p.m.–5 p.m.–9 p.m.–10 a.m.; 5 p.m.–9 p.m.–10 a.m.–2 p.m.; 9 p.m.–10 a.m.–2 p.m.–5 p.m. Along with other measures, participants rated their situation on the RSQ 2.00 with a nine-bin Q-sorter program (1 = 
            <em>not at all characteristic</em>, 9 =

          <em>in situ</em> and 
          <em>ex situ</em> were also at least comparable to what is typically found in perceptions of personality traits or cognitive/affective states (

          Figure 1 specifies that situation characteristics derive from observable 
          <em>situation cues</em> in the environment. Situation cues capture the “ecology” (
          Brunswik, 1952, 
          1956) and thus represent the more objective “environmental” (physical, biological, geographical, meteorological, architectural) level of situations upon which functional or more subjective levels of situation perception (i.e., situation characteristics) are over-laid (
          Block &amp; Block, 1981; 
          Endler, 1981; 
          Nystedt, 1981; 
          Rauthmann, 2012; 
          Saucier et al., 2007). In this study, we thus aim to tie the abstract DIAMONDS dimensions to concrete situation cues (persons and interactions; activities, events, and objects; places) to illuminate the “ingredients” of the DIAMONDS dimensions.

          Pervin, 1978; 
          Saucier et al., 2007), we expected to find situation cues roughly referring to (a) persons, relationships, communication, and interaction; (b) events, objects, and activities; and (c) places. These should be encoded in raters’ 
          <em>in situ</em> written situation descriptions. Since we first had to distill the situation cues from the descriptions, we did not form 
          <em>a priori</em> hypotheses on how they would be associated with the DIAMONDS dimensions. As our analyses were thus not guided by theory but were exploratory, we used two large samples to replicate findings.

In a first exploratory step, all situation descriptions from Samples H and I were read through several times by the first author to get a feel for which situation cues could be coded. This survey yielded 31 situation cues which can be grouped into “Persons and Interactions” (7 cues), “Objects, Events, and Activities” (18 cues), and “Places” (6 cues). This classification is consistent with prior literature (e.g., 
            Pervin, 1978; 
            Saucier et al., 2007). In a second step, each situation description was coded on each of the 31 situation cues by the first author. Codings were done binarily: If a cue was present, then it obtained a score of “1”; if it was not present, then it obtained a score of “0.” Additionally, an undergraduate research assistant coded all situation descriptions so that we could compute 
            Cohen’s (1968) kappa (κ) as the interrater agreement of codings. Values of κ &gt; .75 or .80 can be deemed as denoting almost perfect agreement (
            Fleiss, 1981; 
            Landis &amp; Koch, 1977), and present κs ranged from .80 to 1.00. For the current analyses, the first authors’ codings were used. Descriptions and markers, frequencies, and interrater agreement for each situation cue are presented in the online supplemental materials, Section D (OSM D).

          Table 5, several cues could be tied to each DIAMONDS dimension in the Austrian and U.S. sample: the amount of significant situation cues ranged from 12.19% to 70.97% across both samples. Although there were, on average, more and stronger correlations in the Austrian sample than in the U.S. sample, correlational patterns were generally similar across both. The online supplemental materials, Section E (OSM E), present replicability estimates of findings across samples.

The associations uncovered may further illuminate the nature of each DIAMONDS dimension. A potential limitation of this study is that the only situation cues we extracted came from verbally encoded “thin slice” situation descriptions reported by raters 
          <em>in situ</em>. The descriptions are probably biased toward cues that were salient (i.e., captured selective attention), consciously processed, and easily recalled. More cues can be sampled by recording everyday situations (e.g., with mini-cameras and microphones) and attempting to sample an exhaustive set of cues (e.g., by including tactile/haptic, olfactory, gustatory, vestibular, and unconsciously processed cues). Multimodal cues pertaining to 
          <em>all</em> types of sensory information may be established for each DIAMONDS dimension in future studies.

          2003, 
          2004): What does a situation demand, call for, require, or elicit? Affordances have been described as the relevance of needs, motives, and goals to a situation because “the 
          <em>essence</em> of a situation is its affordance of human goals” (
          Yang et al., 2009, p. 1030, italicized in the original; see also 
          Argyle et al., 1981; 
          Edwards &amp; Templeton, 2005; 
          Yang et al., 2006, 
          2009). Further, affordances may also refer to the probability of the expression of traits (e.g., 
          Kenrick, McCreath, Govern, King, &amp; Bordin, 1990; 
          Saucier et al., 2007; 
          Ten Berge &amp; de Raad, 1999, 
          2001, 
          2002). As the RSQ was not built on an explicit theory of affordances, it may be helpful to examine the goal and trait affordances of the DIAMONDS dimensions. In this study, we thus embed the DIAMONDS dimensions into a rich nomological network of affordances to yield a differentiated picture of which goal and trait content each dimension taps.

            <em>completely</em>) to what extent each situation they read “afforded” or “called for” a trait or motive. We then formed a composite-score for each dimension by mean-aggregating the two ratings. Reliabilities (ICCs and Cronbach’s αs) of these composite-scores can be found in the online supplemental materials, Section F (OSM F), broken down by wave and averaged across waves. The mean ICC for Big Five affordances was .71 (i.e., good agreement), for Big Three motive affordances .76 (i.e., good agreement), and for goal affordances .50 (i.e., moderate agreement).

          Baumeister et al., 2007; 
          Reis, 2008). Indeed, situations are primarily important because of their alleged effects on behavior (
          Argyle et al., 1981; 
          Magnusson, 1981b; 
          Pervin, 1981; 
          Ross &amp; Nisbett, 1991). Consistent with this link between situations and behavior, some strands in situation research have examined similar, expressed, or appropriate behaviors across different situations (e.g., 
          Argyle et al., 1981; 
          Barker, 1963, 
          1968; 
          Barker &amp; Wright, 1951, 
          1955; 
          Wicker, 1979/1984). Accordingly, a situational taxonomy must also explicitly address behavioral sequelae (
          Reis, 2008, p. 315). Hence, situation perceptions should predict behavior enacted 
          <em>in situ</em>, and the usefulness of any new taxonomic model of situation characteristics along with its corresponding psychometric measurement tool hinges upon the question to what extent behavior (whether self-reported, peer-observed, or coder-rated; see 
          Sherman, Nave, &amp; Funder, 2009) can be predicted. Thus, if the DIAMONDS dimensions are to be deemed useful for future research, then they must predict behavior.

          Reis, 2008): Duty was related to achievement-/work-related behaviors, Intellect to intellectual behaviors, Adversity to conflict behaviors, Mating to sexual/romantic behaviors, pOsitivity to social-affiliative and pleasant behaviors, Negativity to unpleasant behaviors, Deception to antagonistic behaviors, and Sociality to social-affiliative behaviors. These findings provide further evidence for the usefulness of the DIAMONDS taxonomy.

Another important objective is to establish the 
          <em>relative usefulness</em> of behavioral predictions. In other words, the predictive power of the DIAMONDS vis-à-vis other measures predicting behavior needs to be demonstrated. Ideally, the DIAMONDS dimensions would be (a) strong predictors of behavior, (b) predict behavior more strongly than other measures, and (c) tap incremental and unique variance not tapped by other measures. The DIAMONDS dimensions should thus outperform personality and other situation measures to be of maximum practical utility when real-world phenomena are to be explained.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Estimations of predictors’ utility or importance 
          <em>relative to</em> other predictors cannot be based on correlation or regression coefficients alone. Recently, 
          Nimon and Oswald (2013) have systematized different metrics that can be used to judge predictors’ relative predictive power (see also 
          Nathans, Oswald, &amp; Nimon, 2012). These metrics are particularly useful when predictor variables are intercorrrelated (multicollinearity) or when suppressor effects may be present (by having many predictors in a regression model). They capitalize on an “all-possible-subsets regression approach” (APS regressions): metrics of relative importance for each predictor 
          <em>p</em> (and sets of predictors) are derived by running regressions for all 2
          <sup><em>p</em></sup> – 1 subsets of predictors. This allows examining different metrics that go beyond traditional correlation and regression coefficients (and do not suffer from multicollinearity or suppression effects).
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Based on the different kinds of metrics available for estimating predictive power, we discriminate three different (but related) aspects of predictive power in this study: incremental, dominant, and unique prediction. First, we need to compare how much 
          <em>incremental variance</em> the DIAMONDS dimensions can add above personality or other situation measures to how much incremental variance personality or other situation measures can add above the DIAMONDS dimensions. The practice of estimating incremental predictive criterion validity has a long-standing history in personality psychological and psychometric literature. In the current case, it yields a first but crude estimate of whether the DIAMONDS dimensions, as a set of predictors, harbor incremental predictive abilities above and beyond personality and other situation measures, as sets, respectively. However, this approach does not readily allow inferences about relative predictive power. Thus, we additionally consider dominant and unique prediction to cast a more differentiated picture on the DIAMONDS dimensions’ predictive abilities.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Second, 
          <em>dominant prediction</em> is contingent upon incremental prediction in the sense that each predictor’s incremental validity is computed across all possible regression submodels with that predictor. The resulting incremental validity coefficients are then used to establish whether there is complete, conditional, or general dominance (
          Nimon &amp; Oswald, 2013). Complete dominance, rarely to be ever achieved, indicates that one predictor dominates another predictor in all submodels of a regression. In most cases, however, it is enough to establish that one predictor is generally more dominant than other predictors across most regression submodels.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Third, 
          <em>unique prediction</em> can be investigated with commonality analysis which partitions the total explained variance of a criterion/dependent variable into unique contributions from each predictor and common contributions shared between all combinations of the predictors. For example, if a dependent variable 
          <em>Z</em> is predicted by three Predictors 
          <em>X</em>1, 
          <em>X</em>2, and 
          <em>X</em>3, then the unique portions of variance (from the total amount of variance that 
          <em>X</em>1, 
          <em>X</em>2, and 
          <em>X</em>3 account for in 
          <em>Z</em>) refer to 
          <em>X</em>1, 
          <em>X</em>2, and 
          <em>X</em>3 separately, whereas the common portions of variance to what is shared between 
          <em>X</em>1-
          <em>X</em>2, 
          <em>X</em>1-
          <em>X</em>3, 
          <em>X</em>2-
          <em>X</em>3, and 
          <em>X</em>1-
          <em>X</em>2-
          <em>X</em>3. 
          Seibold and McPhee (1979) explained that only by “determining the extent to which . . . independent variables, singly and in all combinations, share variance with the dependent variable . . . can we fully know the 
          <em>relative importance</em> of independent variables with regard to the dependent variable in question” (p. 355; italics added for emphasis). In essence, commonality analyses yield commonality coefficients that (a) sum up to the fully explained 
          <em>R</em><sup>2</sup>, (b) can be compared to each other, and (c) are separated into unique and common effects (
          Nimon &amp; Oswald, 2013). The unique effects are of most interest in our context because they tell us something about the “pure” effect of one predictor (relative to other pure effects of other predictors as well as what is shared with other predictors).
        </p><a id="psp-107-4-677-EDCDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Hypotheses</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">To demonstrate the relative usefulness of the DIAMONDS dimensions, we expected that they would outperform personality traits and other situation measures in the prediction of behavior. For competing personality traits, we chose the Big Five because they represent the most widely acknowledged taxonomy of major categories of human individual differences (
          John &amp; Srivastava, 1999). For the same reasons, we used Big Five behaviors as outcome variables. The selection of only five broad behavior dimensions additionally had the benefit of greatly reducing the amount of outcome variables to be considered. For competing situation measures, we chose 
          Van Heck’s (1984, 
          1989) situational taxonomy consisting of ten dimensions (interpersonal conflict, joint working and information exchange, intimacy and interpersonal relations, recreation, traveling, rituals, sport, excesses, serving, trading). It has been described as the most useful taxonomy so far (
          Ten Berge &amp; de Raad, 1999, p. 353) and is thus a good benchmark.
          <a id="b-fn14"> </a><sup /></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We broadly expected that Duty would predict Conscientiousness behavior positively; Intellect Openness behavior positively; Adversity Neuroticism behavior positively and/or Agreeableness behavior negatively; Mating Extraversion behavior positively; pOsitivity Extraversion behavior positively (and Neuroticism behavior negatively); Negativity Neuroticism behavior positively (and Extraversion behavior negatively); Deception Agreeableness behavior negatively; and Sociality Extraversion and Agreeableness behavior positively. These relations should be uncovered in regular correlation and multiple regression analyses, but also in the more sophisticated dominant and unique prediction analyses. Specifically, the DIAMONDS dimensions should represent incremental, dominant, and unique predictors of Big Five behaviors enacted 
          <em>in situ</em> over and above Big Five traits and Van Heck’s situation dimensions.

            <em>Incremental prediction</em> was established by contrasting findings from two sets of hierarchical multiple linear regression analyses (predicting Big Five behavior). The first set contained the competing measures in Block 1 and the DIAMONDS dimensions in Block 2, while the second set contained the DIAMONDS dimensions in Block 1 and the competing measures in Block 2. Results then yield (a) how much variance the DIAMONDS dimensions and competing measures account for together in behavior; (b) how much variance the DIAMONDS dimensions, as a set of predictors, and the competing measures, as a set of predictors, account for separately from each other; and (c) how much incremental variance the DIAMONDS dimensions and the competing measures can account for above and beyond each other, respectively.
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><em>Dominant prediction</em> was established with the calc.yhat function from the R package “yhat” (
            Nimon &amp; Roberts, 2012). Dominance analyses can be used to examine whether one predictor can explain more incremental variance in a criterion variable than another predictor (a) across all possible multiple regression sub-models (i.e., complete dominance) or (b) on average across models of APS sizes (i.e., conditional dominance; 
            Nimon &amp; Oswald, 2013). The average of the conditional dominance weights represents the general dominance weights. We were interested in general dominance, but report complete and conditional dominance in the online supplemental materials.
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><em>Unique prediction</em> was also established with the calc.yhat function from the R package “yhat” (
            Nimon &amp; Roberts, 2012). Commonality analyses can be used to identify unique portions of variance in the totally explained variance of a criterion variable by (a) one predictor alone (uniqueness) and (b) what is shared between several predictors (commonality). We were interested in unique effects only. Because unique effects can be summed, summing together each DIAMONDS dimension’s unique effect equals the total unique effect of all DIAMONDS dimensions combined. Similarly, the unique effects of the “competing” predictors (i.e., personality or other situation measures) can be summed. Then, the summed unique effects of both sets of predictors can be compared to give an estimate of how important the DIAMONDS dimensions, as a set of predictors, are in terms of contributing to predicted variance in a criterion 
            <em>in relation to</em> another set of predictors.

Taken together, the DIAMONDS dimensions harbored incremental, dominant, and unique predictive abilities over and above both Big Five personality traits as well as Van Heck’s situation dimensions as the competing scales. Specifically, the DIAMONDS dimensions (a) were the strongest predictors of behavior with more variance explanation than the competing scales; (b) incrementally tapped variance above and beyond the competing scales (and, specifically, more so than the competing scales could tap beyond them); (c) generally dominated the competing scales in their predictions; and (d) occupied more unique portions of the totally explained variance than the competing scales could. These findings held true for the DIAMONDS dimensions as a set of predictors but also for single dimensions (see 
          Tables 10–13, 
          Figures 4 and 
          5, and OSMs G.1 and G.2). Second, the DIAMONDS dimensions were related meaningfully to self-reported Big Five behavior aggregates as initially predicted. Third, patterns of findings were replicated across the Austrian and U.S. sample, suggesting that they were robust. Thus, we conclude that the DIAMONDS dimensions (encapsulated in the RSQ-8) are useful for predicting real-world phenomena, such as self-reported personality-relevant behavior.

In six studies, we provided evidence that this is the case. Central findings are summarized in 
          Table 14.

We additionally demonstrated how these dimensions could be captured within a shorter, revised version of the RSQ, the RSQ-8. Moreover, we examined in descriptive analyses the prevalence, internal consistency reliabilities, and intercorrelations of the DIAMONDS dimensions. In Study 2, we examined to what extent different raters (i.e., 
          <em>in situ</em> and 
          <em>ex situ</em>) agreed in their perceptions of the DIAMONDS dimensions. We found substantive levels of external and internal–external agreement, indicating that people likely possess shared meaning systems of situations—even if judged only from very thin slice vignettes of static, verbally encoded situation information. As such, the DIAMONDS dimensions may be deemed as “real” dimensions in the sense that people can consensually agree on them. Moreover, these findings underscore the reliability of the DIAMONDS dimensions (as measured with the RSQ-8) because interrater agreement is a necessary condition for reliable assessment. In Studies 3 and 4, we tied the DIAMONDS dimensions to situation cues and affordances to explore their “ingredients” and which goal and trait topics they cover. The DIAMONDS dimensions were conceptually plausibly related to a host of cues and affordances, being embedded into rich nomological networks. In Study 5, we demonstrated that the DIAMONDS dimensions were associated with a variety of different behaviors. The meaningful relations with behavior indicate the usefulness of the DIAMONDS dimensions as situational taxonomies must be able to predict real-life outcomes (e.g., behavioral sequelae). Additionally, we demonstrated in Study 6 that the DIAMONDS dimensions even outperformed other measures (i.e., Big Five traits and Van Heck’s situation dimensions) in the prediction of Big Five relevant behavior. Specifically, the DIAMONDS dimensions harbored incremental, dominant, and unique predictive abilities. These findings underscore the relative predictive power of the DIAMONDS dimensions vis-à-vis Big Five traits and Van Heck’s situation dimensions. Taken together, we could provide extensive and replicable evidence for the meaningfulness, importance, and usefulness of the DIAMONDS dimensions across diverse samples, designs, and methodologies.

            <em>Does something need to be done?</em> As can be seen in 
            Table 15, several similar dimensions have previously been identified in extant literature. In its content, Duty may be tied particularly to the personality dimension of Conscientiousness. In many respects, Duty seemed less compatible with positive, sexual, and social situations, suggesting that situations perceived high on Duty are rather task-oriented than socio-emotional. Moreover, this task-orientation seemed to often carry a negative flavor probably because of the imposition that something 
            <em>has to be</em> done that may require resources such as time, energy, and effort. This does not mean that dutiful situations are asocial in nature; rather, they tend to be perceived as restrictive to positive socialization. Dutiful situations were further relatively common, which can be expected in populations in which culturally valued tasks such as working are demanded in some form (e.g., “going to school” or “going to work”).

It can thus be captured by the question: 
            <em>Is deep thinking required?</em> As can be seen in 
            Table 15, no clear dimension pertaining to Intellect has been identified so far in extant literature. As such, Intellect may represent a novel and interesting addition to previous taxonomies. In its content, Intellect may be tied particularly to the personality dimension of Openness/Intellect/Culture. Interestingly, we found that Intellect was subject to the strongest cross-cultural differences, although we did not investigate these in detail. European (but not so much U.S.) data suggested a strong social aspect of Intellect: Intellectual situations did not just require covert deep, reflective processing, but also the overt display of such processing in social groups. Accordingly, Intellect was strongly linked to social constructs and indicators in some of our samples. The perception of Intellect in social situations may serve adaptive purposes as intellectual abilities and their display constitute important fitness indicators (
            Miller, 2007).
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Adversity</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><em>Adversity</em> (e.g., “Being blamed for something”) describes to what extent people perceive a situation to contain threats, problems, conflict, competition, blaming, criticism, and victimization. It can thus be captured by the question: 
            <em>Is someone threatened?</em> As can be seen in 
            Table 15, several similar dimensions have previously been identified. In its content, Adversity cannot be tied to one particular dimension within extant personality taxonomies, but it could be tied most closely to Neuroticism and (Dis-)Agreeableness. Study 2 indicated that Adversity was the dimension characterized by the lowest agreement. This finding may be explained in several ways. For example, adverse situations (a) have a low base rate (which impacts the familiarity of processing such situations), (b) may not be particularly salient with only few situation cues that reveal the adverse nature of the situation, (c) may be difficult to judge from thin slice information, and (d) may be subject to stronger idiosyncratic perceptions (e.g., what is a harsh critique for one person, may be positively challenging feedback for another). These factors would all contribute to diminished agreement.
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Mating</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><em>Mating</em> (e.g., “Potential romantic partners are present”) describes to what extent people perceive a situation as conducive to sex, love, and romance (including making a good impression, being accepted by potential mates, and maintaining current mates). It can thus be captured by the question: 
            <em>Is the situation sexually or romantically charged?</em> As can be seen in 
            Table 15, no clear dimensions pertaining to Mating have been identified so far in extant literature to the best of our knowledge. However, dimensions pertaining to intimate relationships or family ties may be indirectly relevant (via trajectories of mating: e.g., mate guarding, parental care, etc.). In its content, Mating cannot be tied to one particular dimension within extant personality taxonomies, but it could be tied most closely to Extraversion and Agreeableness, which have been found to pertain to mating (e.g., 
            Nettle, 2006) or sociosexuality (
            Penke &amp; Asendorpf, 2008). Perceptions of Mating may be particularly consequential on the individual level, as they will determine how accurately sexual/romantic chances with others and advances by others are gauged (
            Place, Todd, Penke, &amp; Asendorpf, 2009; 
            Place, Todd, Zhuang, Penke, &amp; Asendorpf, 2012). This, in turn, may increase or decrease individual levels of fitness as defined by reproduction (e.g., if reproductive chances are missed because Mating was not detected).
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>pOsitivity</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><em>pOsitivity</em> (e.g., “Situation is potentially enjoyable”) describes to what extent people perceive a situation as pleasant, fun, enjoyable, playful, simple, clear, and easy-to-navigate. It can thus be captured by the question: 
            <em>Is the situation (or aspects of it) pleasant?</em> As can be seen in 
            Table 15, several similar dimensions pertaining to recreation, favorable outcomes, and pleasure have previously been identified. In its content, pOsitivity can be tied particularly to the personality dimensions of Positive Valence and Extraversion as trait Positive Affect. Along with Negativity, pOsitivity belongs to the two “valence” factors in the DIAMONDS dimensions. This means that it does not represent concrete content per se, but rather positive affective evaluations of situations. As could be expected, this dimension is thus particularly salient to perceivers, embedded into a rich nomological network with many situational and behavioral correlates. Moreover, people strongly agree on pOsitivity, probably because of culturally shared meaning systems of what is “pleasant” and what can be approached (e.g., 
            Murray, 1938).
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Negativity</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><em>Negativity</em> (e.g., Situation is potentially anxiety-inducing) describes to what extent a situation may elicit any sort of negative feeling (e.g., frustration, anxiety, tension, guilt, anger, etc.). It can thus be captured by the question: 
            <em>Can negative feelings ensue?</em> As can be seen in 
            Table 15, several similar dimensions pertaining to negative emotions or aspects of a situation have previously been identified. In its content, Negativity can be tied particularly to the personality dimensions of Negative Valence and Neuroticism as trait Negative Affect. Along with pOsitivity, Negativity belongs to the two “valence” factors in the DIAMONDS dimensions. It captures negative affective evaluations of a situation. As such, this dimension is salient to perceivers and possesses strong levels of internal consistency and agreement, alluding to culturally shared meaning systems of what is “unpleasant” (in spite of the fact that negative situations were not particularly common). Negativity was also a relatively strong predictor of behavior. These findings are in line with the principle that “organisms that were better attuned to bad things would have been more likely to survive threats [which] would have increased [the] probability of passing along their genes” (
            Baumeister, Bratslavsky, Finkenauer, &amp; Vohs, 2001, p. 325). It may thus be evolutionarily adaptive to attend (particularly) to negative characteristics in situations, which would explain the saliency and relatively high amounts of agreement observed for Negativity.
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Deception</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><em>Deception</em> (e.g., It is possible to deceive someone) describes to what extent people perceive a situation to contain mistrust, deception, lying, betrayal, and hostility. It can thus be captured by the question: 
            <em>Are there issues of (mis-)trust?</em> As can be seen in 
            Table 15, no dimensions pertaining to Deception have been identified so far in extant literature so that Deception may represent a novel and interesting addition to previous taxonomies. In its content, Deception could be tied particularly to the personality dimensions of Agreeableness and Honesty/Humility or to the Dark Triad (i.e., sub-clinical narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy; 
            Paulhus &amp; Williams, 2002). Hence, Deception may be fruitful particularly for research on “darker” aspects of social dilemma games and interpersonal trust. The lower agreement in Deception found in Study 2 may be explained by (a) a relatively low base rate of deceptive situations (i.e., unfamiliarity with such situations), (b) less “visibility” of such situations (as they should not be apparent to others), and (c) the operation of individual moral systems (e.g., what may constitute moral “gray area” for one person, may be immoral to another).
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Sociality</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><em>Sociality</em> (e.g., Social interaction is possible) describes to what extent people perceive a situation to contain socializing, communicating, (pleasant) interaction, relationship formation, interpersonal warmth, and reassurance. It can thus be captured by the question: 
            <em>Is social interaction present or important?</em> As can be seen in 
            Table 15, several similar dimensions have been previously identified. Indeed, there is hardly any taxonomy that misses to address or incorporate social information. In its content, Sociality may be tied particularly to the personality dimensions of Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Communion. Social-interpersonal situations occupy the majority of situations encountered in everyday lives (
            Kelley et al., 2003; 
            Reis, 2008). In line with this, situations perceived as social were the most common and judged with the highest amounts of agreement. This suggests that there are strong, culturally shared meaning systems for Sociality, which eases the processing of this dimension. Moreover, it is embedded into a wildly rich nomological network with strong ties to other situational variables and behavior. As such, perceptions of Sociality can be very consequential, as they may determine to what extent and how social behaviors are expressed and interpersonal relations formed.

We examined with vector correlations to what extent the DIAMONDS dimensions shared similar situation cues (across 31 correlations), affordances (across 41 correlations, including Van Heck’s dimensions), and behaviors (across 67 correlations). Vector correlations are displayed in the online supplemental materials, Section H (OSM H). For 
          <em>situation cues</em>, similar patterns were shared by (a) Duty and Negativity and (b) Mating, pOsitivity, and Sociality. For 
          <em>affordances</em>, similar patterns were shared by (a) Duty and Negativity, (b) Adversity and Deception, and (c) Mating, pOsitivity, and Sociality. For 
          <em>behaviors</em>, similar patterns were shared by (a) Duty, Adversity, Negativity, and Deception and (b) Mating, pOsitivity, and Sociality. All vector intercorrelation matrices were additionally meta-analytically pooled with the statsBy function in the R package “psych” (
          Revelle, 2013) to gain a better picture of which DIAMONDS dimensions showed similar patterns. Findings are graphically presented in the online supplemental materials, Section I (OSM I). Sociality, pOsitivity, and Mating formed one cluster (“approach characteristics”), while Duty, Adversity, and Deception formed another cluster (“avoidance characteristics”). Negativity loaded negatively onto approach and positively into avoidance characteristics. Intellect did not show a clear loading. Generally, approach and avoidance characteristics showed dissimilar patterns to each other. Thus, situations with pleasant characteristics differed markedly from situations with unpleasant characteristics in their situational and behavioral correlates.

For the DIAMONDS taxonomy to be useful for further research, it should at least subsume if not extend most content identified in previous situational taxonomies. 
          Table 15 synoptically lists how content from different situation dimensions identified in previous literature (pertaining to classes, characteristics, and cues) correspond to the DIAMONDS dimensions. As can be seen, the DIAMONDS dimensions are fairly inclusive and subsume most previously identified situation dimensions. Specifically, Duty, Adversity, pOsitivity, Negativity, and Sociality have already been described in one way or the other. In contrast, Intellect, Mating, and Deception have only few if any counterparts in extant taxonomies. Indeed, from our literature review on situational taxonomies (see Introduction and Background of Study 1), these dimensions would not have been expected. Previous taxonomies may have missed or at least underrepresented content of these dimensions so that they could not be clearly extracted. As such, the DIAMONDS taxonomy represents an advance in content coverage.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Do the DIAMONDS dimensions exhaustively cover the domain of psychologically important situation characteristics? For example, dimensions such as constrained versus unconstrained (
          Hacker, 1981; 
          Pervin, 1976; 
          Nascimento-Schulze, 1981), involvement versus uninvolvement (e.g., 
          Eckes, 1995; 
          Forgas, 1976; 
          King &amp; Sorrentino, 1983), active/control versus passive/affectedness (e.g., 
          Magnusson, 1971; 
          Saucier et al., 2007), formal versus informal (e.g., 
          Eckes, 1995), familiar versus unfamiliar (e.g., 
          Eckes, 1995), (daily) routine versus uncommonness (e.g., 
          Ten Berge &amp; de Raad, 2001), or short versus long durated (e.g., 
          King &amp; Sorrentino, 1983) have repeatedly been identified. 
          Block and Block (1981) additionally list different parameters such as structure, convergency, divergency, evaluation, feedback, constraint, impedance, malleability, galvanization, familiarity, and differentiation/complexity. None of these dimensions are represented in our DIAMONDS taxonomy. This absence can be explained by the fact that the DIAMONDS dimensions capture 
          <em>content</em> dimensions, while the other dimensions (e.g., involvement) concern 
          <em>style</em> dimensions. Style dimensions may be best seen as abstract “modifiers” of more concrete content dimensions. This is analogous to how behavior can be described in terms of abstract content (e.g., “socializing” = extraverted behavior), but also in terms of style or 
          <em>how</em> the behavior is executed (e.g., “intense” or “awkward” socializing). Thus, each DIAMONDS dimension can be modified by additionally attending to one or more style dimensions. Such modifications can concretize the DIAMONDS dimensions. For example, Adversity and Deception can be concretized with the style of 
          <em>activity-passivity</em>: Am I the “sender” of Adversity/Deception (Active) or am I the “receiver” (Passive)? Particularly Adversity (Am I being threatened by someone? Am I threatening someone? Am I watching someone being threatened by someone else?) and Deception (Am I deceiving someone? Am I being deceived by someone? Am I watching someone being deceived by someone else?) may profit from these concretizations which could enhance people’s agreement on these dimensions (see Study 2).

It samples each DIAMONDS dimension with four items and thus contains 32 items instead of the original 89-item version. Indeed, each study we presented provided also evidence for the sound psychometric functioning of the RSQ-8 (i.e., factorial structure, reliability, construct validity, criterion validity). As the RSQ-8 showed good psychometric properties in our studies, the DIAMONDS dimensions can be sampled in a sound, yet economic way. The final RSQ-8 can be found in the 
          Appendix.
          <a id="b-fn17"> </a><sup /> A 7- or 9-point Likert-type scale or Q-sorting bin ranging from 
          <em>extremely uncharacteristic of the situation</em> to 
          <em>extremely characteristic of the situation</em> should work best with these items.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">There are several future directions we foresee for the RSQ-8. First, the items of the RSQ-8 may be further refined and honed to optimally capture the DIAMONDS dimensions. The trade-off between internal consistency and breadth of content coverage will be crucial in this endeavor. Second, the 32-item RSQ-8 measure may be further shortened. Particularly for studies seeking to evaluate the perception of stimuli (e.g., for manipulation check reasons) or using an experience sampling design for the ambulatory assessment of situation characteristics, shorter versions of the RSQ-8 may be desirable. Lastly, the RSQ-8 can be used to validate different and more refined measures of the DIAMONDS dimensions to be constructed in the future (e.g., based on lexical analyses or lay people’s free-word associations). As such, it can function as a “benchmark” measure in terms of construct and criterion validity.</p><a id="psp-107-4-677-ECBDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Merits and Usefulness of the DIAMONDS Taxonomy</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Why is the DIAMONDS taxonomy useful? We conducted an informal survey with scholars (
          <em>n</em> = 8) with a firm background/training in personality/social psychology specifically selected for their expertise in situations and/or person × situation interactions.
          <a id="b-fn18"> </a><sup /> We asked them to think about a basic study where they would want to assess characteristics of persons (i.e., traits) and situations. Specifically, they were to name three measures to assess personality (along with their constructs) and three measures to assess situations (along with their constructs). The results were striking. First, all experts could readily name three personality measures along with their specific personality constructs (usually the Big Five). Second, the experts could neither name a concrete situation measure (except for the RSQ) nor situation dimensions to be captured in them. Third, some experts indicated that they would have to use 
          <em>ad hoc</em> constructed instruments specifically tailored for their research needs. These results underscore a very real and dire problem: There does not seem to be any standard and economical psychometrically validated measure of situation characteristics or any specific dimensions one would compare situations on (at least none anyone knows of—not even experts). Almost any researcher would resort to the Big Five if he/she wanted to sample personality. But what would one resort to when wanting to assess the psychological situation economically?
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">This is where the DIAMONDS taxonomy harbors several advantages that make it practically useful for research on situations and their characteristics. First, we believe that the most relevant gist of broad psychological situation characteristics is covered. Same as researchers using the Big Five, we do not contend that the DIAMONDS dimensions exhaustively cover all characteristics there may be. However, they are inclusive enough to cover the most salient and important ones in everyday lives and laboratory studies. Organizing previous situation dimensions into the DIAMONDS taxonomy (see 
          Table 15) supports our notion.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Second, we have given the uncovered dimensions clear labels, which in their entirety form the easily memorable acronym DIAMONDS (see OCEAN’s Big Five). We wanted to enable researchers to easily name specific dimensions/constructs to assess the psychological situations of their participants. This has the added effect of cutting through the jingle-jangle jungle of situation terms and thereby facilitating the communication among and between research teams—which has so far not been possible. Eventually, the DIAMONDS taxonomy may also provide a useful framework within which to locate scattered, previously identified dimensions (see 
          Table 15) and thus guide future research in a more systematic way (same as the Big Five have started to guide personality trait research).
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Third, we have provided a psychometrically sound measure to assess the DIAMONDS dimensions, the RSQ-8. This should greatly aid researchers who want to assess the psychological situation(s) of their participants. To the best of our (and the experts’) knowledge, no other taxonomy has produced reliable and valid scales that could be used for research.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Lastly, the current string of research can be considered unique in several ways that distinguish the DIAMONDS taxonomy from previous situational taxonomies and make it uniquely helpful:

          
<br /><ol type="1"><li>This work focused solely on a taxonomy of psychological characteristics and not of classes (taxonomizing situations per se into categories) or of cues (taxonomizing concrete elements within situations). As outlined in the Introduction, most extant situational taxonomies did not specifically target situation characteristics.</li><li>A fairly inclusive sampling of situation characteristics was achieved by using the RSQ, whereas previous research has restricted characteristics to only a few in relatively narrow domains (see 
                Yang et al., 2009). The RSQ, however, encompasses broad content (
                Sherman et al., 2010; 
                Wagerman &amp; Funder, 2009; see OSM A).
              </li><li>The, as of yet, broadest range of real, naturally occurred situations in the daily lives of large samples were gathered, whereas previous research has sampled far less situations and/or restricted situations to circumscribed domains (see 
                Yang et al., 2009).
              </li><li>Different samples (with sufficiently large sample sizes) and different methodologies in a set of six studies were utilized. In doing so, the patterns of findings (see OSM E) could be replicated to show that they were robust across different samples and methods.</li><li>The predictive power of the DIAMONDS dimensions (and the scales measuring them) was empirically demonstrated. Such demonstrations have not been reported for any other taxonomy so far (mainly because they did not produce any assessment methods).</li></ol></p><a id="psp-107-4-677-EBBDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Implications of and Future Directions With the DIAMONDS Taxonomy</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">This work represents a 
          <em>first step</em> toward a common framework within which to capture major dimensions of situation characteristics. We foresee following eight lines of research that will profit from the DIAMONDS dimensions: uniform communication in research on situation characteristics, compatibility with personality taxonomies, description of momentary situations and enduring life spaces, situational similarity, situation classification, individual differences in situation perception, situation change, and validity checks.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Uniform communication in research on situation characteristics</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The DIAMONDS taxonomy may integrate and reconcile previous taxonomies within a common language (see 
            Table 15). This should help enhance uniform communication within and beyond situation research as past and future taxonomies of situation characteristics can be located within the DIAMONDS language. The DIAMONDS dimensions may help us knowing what it is that we are looking for in future dimensional analyses of situation characteristics, which has not been possible so far.
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Compatibility with personality taxonomies</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The DIAMONDS dimensions are compatible in content with major dimensions of personality (see Study 1). This squares with 
            Johnson’s (1999, pp. 450–451) critique that “one of the problems is researchers’ failure to use the same kind of descriptive unit for traits and situations.” In other words, situational taxonomies ought to bear some content resemblance to personality taxonomies to make them most useful for personality research (see also 
            Ten Berge &amp; de Raad, 1999, 
            2001, 
            2002). Using the DIAMONDS dimensions, situation and personality taxonomies can speak a common language, which will eventually aid in exploring the full Personality Triad of persons, situations, and behavior. For example, person–environment fit research questions command that characteristics of persons and situations/environments be conceptually commensurate (
            Rauthmann, 2013; 
            Kristof-Brown &amp; Guay, 2011): persons and situations should be sampled on the same or conceptually similar content dimensions. Thus, the DIAMONDS dimensions could be usefully applied to person–environment fit research in conjunction with Big Five/Six/Seven assessments of people’s traits.
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Description of momentary situations and enduring life spaces</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The DIAMONDS dimensions can be used to characterize momentary situations (e.g., “Being at a party at 10 p.m.”) or enduring life spaces (e.g., “Being in the middle of a divorce”). The former represent snapshots or glimpses in people’s lives, whereas the latter represent chronic constellations (e.g., work, marriage, etc.) that constitute a person’s habitual environment or socio-ecological niche with distinctive goal, rule, and role structures (
            Argyle et al., 1981). Life spaces may also be characterized in terms of the DIAMONDS dimensions to study their effects on intrapersonal (e.g., physical and mental health, affect, self-esteem, stress, strain, trauma, etc.) and interpersonal adjustment (e.g., popularity, social support). Moreover, small effects of concurrent situation perception on behavior and health may accumulate over time to produce strongly consequential effects (
            Serfass &amp; Sherman, 2013; 
            Sherman et al., 2013). This may be tested with the DIAMONDS dimensions.
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Situational similarity</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The DIAMONDS dimensions can be used to compare different situations with each other (
            Funder, 2001; 
            Mischel &amp; Peake, 1983; 
            Reis, 2008) to aid a “differential psychology of situations” (
            Endler, 1981; 
            Magnusson, 1978, 
            1981). Until now, situations could not be compared sufficiently in between-situations analyses on a few dimensions in the same manner as persons can be compared on the Big Five, for example. Thus, investigations of situational similarity (e.g., 
            Champagne &amp; Pervin, 1987; 
            Furr &amp; Funder, 2004; 
            Sherman et al., 2010) can benefit from the DIAMONDS taxonomy. Situational similarity may then be used to predict consistent or coherent behavior (because people should behave more consistently when situations are similar; see 
            Sherman et al., 2010) or to examine which situations may cluster together because they share common characteristics (see next point below).
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Situation classification</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">According to 
            Magnusson (1981c, p. 24), situations can be classified according to how they are perceived. Classes, types, or groups of similar situations could be distinguished based on profile constellations of the DIAMONDS dimensions. This is analogous to type-research with personality traits: There are distinct trait profiles that mark different types of people. In the same vein, there could be distinct DIAMONDS profiles that mark different types of situations. The number and make-up of these profiles (e.g., extracted by latent class/dimension analyses) would determine the quantity and nature of situation classes. Thus, the DIAMONDS dimensions may also help develop a taxonomy of situation classes.
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Individual differences in situation perception</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Individual differences in situation perception have been described as “potentially one of the most meaningful and fruitful bases we have for characterizing individuals” (
            Magnusson, 1981c, p. 28; see also 
            Magnusson, 1971, 
            1974, 
            1976, 
            1981a; 
            Forgas, 1976). However, it has so far not been possible to perform between-person analyses on state and habitual situation perception because it has not been clear on which situational dimensions to compare people. People may vary in their selective attention to, familiarity with, and processing of each DIAMONDS dimension. As such, DIAMONDS perceptions may vary across persons for one situation (interindividual differences) and across different situations for one person (intraindividual differences). Knowledge on how individuals momentarily and chronically perceive situations can particularly benefit applied issues (
            Magnusson, 1981c, p. 30) such as clinical diagnoses (e.g., misperceptions due to dysfunctional schemata) or the estimation of treatment and intervention effects in therapy (e.g., whether situation evaluations have changed). For example, it would be desirable to protocol after prolonged therapy that perceptions of situations’ Adversity, Negativity, and Deception have been reduced in narcissistic patients.
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Situation change</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The DIAMONDS dimensions may help elucidate a traditionally daunting problem in situation research: the demarcations of situations and how they change or flow into one another. The DIAMONDS dimensions can be used to “segment” situations into distinct psychologically relevant phases or cycles as situations may “change in significant ways despite the fact that their characters, location, and basic content [i.e., situation cues] remain the same” (
            Pervin, 1981, p. 359). Since the DIAMONDS dimensions capture perceived situation characteristics that are partly based on situation cues (see Study 3) but may also operate independently from them (i.e., they contain surplus meaning beyond situation cues due to people’s construal process of the psychological situation), they are uniquely equipped to understand situation change. Hence, the DIAMONDS dimensions may be used to examine how, when, and why situations change in their characteristics as well as how the “flow” of situations in the stream of a person’s daily life unfolds (
            Rauthmann &amp; Sherman, 2014).
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Validity checks</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The DIAMONDS dimensions can be used to examine/validate stimulus material. For example, automated protocols and computerized text analyses (e.g., 
            Tausczik &amp; Pennebaker, 2010) can be fine-tuned to extract verbally encoded DIAMONDS content, such as from transcripted everyday conversations, Internet writings (in blogs, memes, forums etc.), the Bible, dreams, or stories prompted by Rorschach or TAT cards. Moreover, experimental stimuli and conditions can be optimized for desired effects (“Do participants really interpret the stimulus or the situation the way they should?”). As a further consequence, the DIAMONDS dimensions may also be used for manipulation checks in experiments (“Did the manipulation of a stimulus result in a within- or between-subjects change of the perceived characteristics of the experimental situation?”). It is important to assess whether perceptions of experimental situations vary as a function of the manipulation of objective cues. Only then can we assert that (consciously represented) situations differed between experimental groups or measurement points. DIAMONDS perceptions can thus function as the mediating variables between experimentally manipulated objective situation cues and contingent behavioral outcomes (see 
            Magnusson, 1981b, p. 24).
          </p><a id="psp-107-4-677-EABDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Desiderata</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Future research should seek to replicate, corroborate, and extend the findings presented in this work. First, the DIAMONDS dimensions should be extracted from different data sources and situation pools than the RSQ to demonstrate their universality. For example, situational idioms from different cultures (
          Yang et al., 2006), adjectives (
          Edwards &amp; Templeton, 2005), free associations of situation characteristics (e.g., by asking laypersons about the salient characteristics of situations with an open answering format), or goal-formulations of situations (
          Yang et al., 2009) may be used as “input” to derive the DIAMONDS dimensions.
          <a id="b-fn19"> </a><sup /> Ideally, these replication efforts would also entail cross-cultural comparisons (which we explicitly eschewed as we did not have enough cultures and enough situation ratings within each culture). To the extent that the DIAMONDS dimensions can be consistently recovered across different samples, cultures, (methods of deriving) situation pools, measurement methods, and data-analytical procedures, they may eventually develop into the “Situational Big Eight.”
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Second, we examined factor structures with situations freely varying across persons. While this approach ensures a sufficiently broad coverage of real, naturalistic situations, different sources of variance are confounded in situation ratings. As explained in 
          Rauthmann (2012), any situation rating is necessarily a function 
          <em>at least</em> of variance due to the perceiver, the situation, the perceiver × situation interaction, and random error. A variance decomposition approach, however, presupposes that multiple perceivers rate 
          <em>the same</em> standardized set of situation stimuli (e.g., vignettes, pictures, video clips, etc.). Thus, ideally, a large and population-representative sample of perceivers would rate each situation from a representative sample of situations
          <a id="b-fn20"> </a><sup /> on a comprehensive set of situation characteristics. These data would need to be analyzed with multi-mode factor analysis (
          Gorsuch, 1983/2008; 
          Kiers &amp; van Mechelen, 2001) as they contain the modes of person, situation, and characteristics. While such data would enable disentangling sources of variance, realizing such designs may be extremely time-consuming and impractical.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Third, it would be desirable to have situation ratings made truly 
          <em>in situ</em> with ambulatory assessment or experience sampling methodology (ESM; see 
          Shiffman, Stone, &amp; Hufford, 2008; see also 
          <a id="b-fn8"> </a><sup>Footnote 8</sup> in the present article). ESM was unfeasible for this research, which was concerned with establishing major dimensions from a relatively large set of items. ESM data on DIAMONDS perceptions can offer rich time-series information on within- and between-person as well as within- and between-situation structures and processes.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Lastly, this work did not provide a concrete 
          <em>theory</em> around the DIAMONDS dimensions, much like early research on personality trait taxonomies. However, first demonstrations of new concepts are often more exploratory and descriptive. In the process of establishing, replicating, corroborating, and refining the DIAMONDS dimensions, we expect that theory will be fleshed out gradually. We could not conduct top-down research simply because there is no integrated theory on situations and their classes, cues, and characteristics yet. Rather, we had to rely on a bottom-up approach for the current research. However, theoretical bolstering of the DIAMONDS dimensions will be an important task for the future. First, the perceptual, cognitive, affective, motivational, and regulatory processes (e.g., 
          Endsley, 1995a, 
          1995b) underlying DIAMONDS perceptions can be fleshed out (see the box with the dotted lines in 
          Figure 1): How do we recognize situation cues? How do we synthesize perceptions into an interpreted situation gestalt? How do we extrapolate consequences situations based on their characteristics? Second, the momentary significance of the DIAMONDS dimensions in terms of their actual genesis (How do we come to perceive DIAMONDS characteristics in momentary instances?), ontogenesis (How do we acquire perceptual modules attuned to the DIAMONDS characteristics in our development across the life span?), and phylogenesis (Which ancestral affordances or presses led to the evolution of perceptual modules attuned to the DIAMONDS characteristics in humans?) should be addressed. Taken together, an integrated DIAMONDS Theory would ideally tackle (a) proximate and ultimate functions, (b) within- and between-person 
          <em>and</em> situation structures and processes, and (c) short-term and long-term consequences and trajectories.

For the definition problem, we proposed a simple working model of situation perception that allowed us to investigate psychological characteristics of situations. For the taxonomization problem, we established and described the Situational Eight DIAMONDS dimensions Duty, Intellect, Adversity, Mating, pOsitivity, Negativity, and Sociality. For the measurement problem, we provided a psychometric tool for measuring these DIAMONDS dimensions with the newly developed RSQ-8.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Uncertainties and inconsistencies in the situation literature may lead to researchers (a) abstaining from assessing psychological situations or (b) using self-constructed and unvalidated measures that are barely comparable. Both outcomes are problematic and will not lead to fruitful contributions to personality psychology (and person × situation interaction research in particular). This problem motivated the DIAMONDS taxonomy: We wanted a taxonomy of psychologically meaningful characteristics that (a) can describe most if not all situations on only a few major dimensions (see Study 1); (b) is broadly associated with other phenomena (see Studies 3–5); (c) possesses strong predictive powers (see Study 6); (d) is in principle compatible with personality taxonomies, especially in content (see 
        Table 14); (e) is embedded into previous literature and will hence facilitate a common language (see 
        Table 15); and (c) can be assessed with a psychometrically sound, yet economic measure (see the RSQ-8 in the 
        Appendix). Taken together, our objective was to provide a taxonomy and measure that can be 
        <em>practically used</em> and spur further research. At 
        
<a href="http://www.bigeightdiamonds.com" target="_blank">www.bigeightdiamonds.com</a> interested researchers can find more information on the DIAMONDS dimensions, interact and discuss with each other, and collaborate on projects and share findings. Ultimately, we hope that the Situational Eight DIAMONDS dimensions can serve as a useful first step toward a common framework for research on psychological situations, their characteristics, and person × situation interactions.

Judging from mean Cronbach’s alphas across all samples, the DIAMONDS dimensions can be sorted into following descending order: Negativity (
          <em>M</em>α = .74), Mating (
          <em>M</em>α = .68), Adversity (
          <em>M</em>α = .65), pOsitivity (

          <em>juxta situm</em> who observed the situations directly without actively participating, but for the present project, based on self-reports of real-life situations, this was not practical. The direct 
          <em>juxta situm</em> observation of situations remains an important direction for future research.

        </p><a id="fn10" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><sup>10</sup> We also computed intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) to assess agreement between different raters. Findings between ICCs and Pearson’s 
          <em>r</em>s were highly similar, yielding the same substantive conclusions. Pearson’s 
          <em>r</em>s may, however, be preferred for the current data as indices of agreement (see 
          Furr, 2010). For comparison’s sake, the ICC estimates are also displayed in 
          Table 4, but we only discuss 
          <em>r</em> estimates.

          <em>ex situ</em> and DIAMONDS rated

          <em>ex situ</em> with DIAMONDS rated 
          <em>ex situ</em> lead to correlations stronger in magnitude (because of an inflation due to the common variance source of raters 
          <em>ex situ</em>), but the pattern of findings remained highly similar and was thus replicated.
        </p><a id="fn14" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><sup>14</sup> As noted in the Introduction, the current research is unique so that there are no fully comparable taxonomies. In the absence of a real benchmark taxonomy of psychological situation characteristics to compete with, we chose Van Heck’s situational taxonomy because of (a) the methodological rigor it has undergone, (b) its inclusiveness (with 10 dimensions it has more dimensions than other taxonomies), and (c) particularly its appraisal by other researchers (e.g., 
          Ten Berge &amp; de Raad, 1999). However, there are also several limitations to this taxonomy. First, it was derived from a lexical approach and may hence be restricted to the vocabulary of its language (Dutch). Second, the taxonomy did not strictly produce major dimensions of situation characteristics, but rather a mixture of classes and cues. Third, there is no valid measure of these dimensions as of yet. In fairness, however, no other situational taxonomy has produced a valid measure either. All things considered, Van Heck’s situational taxonomy nonetheless represents the best possible benchmark for the DIAMONDS dimensions.
        </p><a id="fn15" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><sup>15</sup> The reported associations may originate from different person–environment transactions (e.g., 
          Buss, 1987): reactive (i.e., processing of situations), selective (i.e., voluntary choice of situations), evocative (i.e., involuntary elicitation of situations), or proactive/manipulative (i.e., generation and alteration of situations once in them). Disentangling which of these transactions account for the observed links between personality and the DIAMONDS dimensions may be a daunting but potentially very informative task.
        </p><a id="fn16" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><sup>16</sup> The patterns of findings were relatively replicable (for quantifications of this replicability, see OSM E). Nonetheless, some differences emerged between Samples H and I. In most cases, effect sizes were more pronounced in Sample H than in Sample I. Apart from cultural differences (Austria vs. United States), this may also be partly traced back to the use of a Likert-type version of the RSQ in Sample H and a Q-sort version in Sample I.</p><a id="fn17" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><sup>17</sup> We advise using the slightly revised phrasing of the items presented in the

        </p><a id="fn18" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><sup>18</sup> Twelve scholars were asked in total, of which eight responded. Six respondents participated in the expert meeting of “Situations and Person × Situation Interactions,” funded by the European Association of Personality Psychology (EAPP) and organized by the first and last author of this work. Authors of this work who also participated in this expert meeting were excluded 
          <em>a priori</em> from the survey.
        </p><a id="fn19" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><sup>19</sup> We did not use these approaches for different reasons. First, situations are often not characterized by only one adjective (cf. 
          Edwards &amp; Templeton, 2005), but rather by more complex linguistic/syntactic relations (see 
          Saucier et al., 2007, pp. 496/497). Second, we did not resort to free associations from participants as these often involve descriptions of situation cues rather than psychologically important characteristics (see, e.g., 
          Saucier et al., 2007). Lastly, we did not employ a goal-oriented frame onto our research (but see Study 4) although situations have been frequently understood in terms of goal processes and content (e.g., 
          Murray, 1938; 
          Yang et al., 2006, 
          2009). Conceptually, we wanted to make a strict distinction between person and situation aspects. Conceptualizing situations primarily in terms of psychologically important perceptions of situations (as we did) already brings situations partly into the realm of the person. However, going yet another step further and defining situations in terms of (what happens to) what kinds of goals people pursue almost entirely cancels out the situation in favor of the person. Although we conceptualize chronic and momentarily activated affect, goals, motives, needs, intentions, and internal regulatory processes as accompanying person-bound elements of situations, we do not see them as constituents (for similar arguments, see 
          Saucier et al., 2007, pp. 498/499). At best, these processes may function as moderating variables (see 
          Figure 1).
        </p><a id="fn20" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><sup>20</sup> There are several problems with such research. First, there is no consensus or list on a representative set of situations. Indeed, it may be questionable if something like this can exist at all (see 
          Mischel, 1977, pp. 337–338). Second, a list would probably just consist of situation vignettes so that ecologically valid experiences in real, natural situations could not be sampled. Third, gathering the proposed data would be utterly laborious.
