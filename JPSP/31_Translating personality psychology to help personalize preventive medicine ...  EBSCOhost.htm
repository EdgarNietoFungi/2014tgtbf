Physicians will face more young adult patients, which presents an opportunity for more prevention-oriented care. In the present study, we evaluated whether brief observer reports of young adults’ personality traits could predict which individuals would be at greater risk for poor health as they entered midlife. Following the cohort of 1,000 individuals from the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study (Moffitt, Caspi, Rutter, &amp; Silva, 2001), we show that very brief measures of young adults’ personalities predicted their midlife physical health across multiple domains (metabolic abnormalities, cardiorespiratory fitness, pulmonary function, periodontal disease, and systemic inflammation). Individuals scoring low on the traits of Conscientiousness and Openness to Experience went on to develop poorer health even after accounting for preexisting differences in education, socioeconomic status, smoking, obesity, self-reported health, medical conditions, and family medical history. Moreover, personality ratings from peer informants who knew participants well, and from a nurse and receptionist who had just met participants for the first time, predicted health decline from young adulthood to midlife despite striking differences in level of acquaintance. Personality effect sizes were on par with other well-established health risk factors such as socioeconomic status, smoking, and self-reported health. We discuss the potential utility of personality measurement to function as an inexpensive and accessible tool for health care professionals to personalize preventive medicine. Adding personality information to existing health care electronic infrastructures could also advance personality theory by generating opportunities to examine how personality processes influence doctor–patient communication, health service use, and patient outcomes.

        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Although most of the clinical burden of age-related diseases (e.g., cardiovascular disease, type II diabetes, hypertension) occurs after midlife, it is now well established that the pathophysiology of these diseases begins earlier in life and accumulates across the life course (
        Weintraub et al., 2011). Accordingly, health professionals are placing increased emphasis on targeting younger populations for disease prevention (
        Kavey, Simons-Morton, &amp; de Jesus, 2011; 
        McGill &amp; McMahan, 2003). Various algorithm-based models (e.g., Framingham Risk Score, Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation, Reynolds Risk Score) are available to facilitate health risk stratification (see 
        Berger, Jordan, Lloyd-Jones, &amp; Blumenthal, 2010, for an overview), but these have limited efficacy in patients younger than 30 years (
        Berry, Lloyd-Jones, Garside, &amp; Greenland, 2007), in part because medical-based tests in young adults do not provide clear clinical direction. Consequently, primary care practitioners use complementary approaches such as medical record reviews, family histories of disease, and patient surveys of lifestyle habits (e.g., diet, smoking) to forecast an individual patient’s potential health risk. In this study, we examined whether brief observer reports of personality administered in young adulthood were able to improve prediction of people’s health at midlife.

        Sommers &amp; Kronick, 2012). Primary care physicians will face more patients whose needs are unfamiliar to them. A vision for orienting health care to better meet patients’ needs has been set forth in a recent report by the Institute of Medicine (
        M. Smith, Saunders, Stuckhardt, &amp; McGinnis, 2013). The report calls for greater patient centeredness in the health care system, stressing the benefit of attending to patients’ preferences, values, and characteristic patterns of feeling, thinking, and behaving—in short, their personality (
        Funder, 1997; 
        John, Robins, &amp; Pervin, 2010; 
        Roberts, 2009). How can health care practitioners get to know their patients? Personality traits can be measured cheaply, easily, and reliably; are stable over many years; and have far-ranging effects on important life outcomes, including morbidity and early mortality. The magnitude of personality effects are on par with other well-established factors such as IQ and socioeconomic status (Deary, Weiss, &amp; Batty, 2011; 
        Roberts, Kuncel, Shiner, Caspi, &amp; Goldberg, 2007).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Although earlier research has shown that personality traits predict health and disease (
        Booth-Kewley &amp; Friedman, 1987), this earlier research used a bewildering variety of approaches to define personality. The resulting proliferation of assessment tools and piecemeal research made it difficult for clinicians to know what personality measures to use, or how to use them. The past two decades have led to a consensus among psychologists that personality differences can be organized along five broad dimensions: Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism, Conscientiousness, and Openness to Experience (with the useful acronym, OCEAN; 
        John &amp; Srivastava, 1999). These so-called Big Five personality traits provide structure for framing previous findings (
        Digman, 1990; 
        Marshall, Wortman, Vickers, Kusulas, &amp; Hervig, 1994; 
        McCrae &amp; John, 1992; 
        T. W. Smith, 2006; 
        T. W. Smith &amp; Williams, 1992) and guiding translation to clinical practice.

        Hill, Turiano, Hurd, Mroczek, &amp; Roberts, 2011; 
        Kern &amp; Friedman, 2008). Numerous studies also lend support to the involvement of Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism in health processes (
        Chapman, Roberts, &amp; Duberstein, 2011; 
        Sutin, Ferrucci, Zonderman, &amp; Terracciano, 2011; 
        Sutin et al., 2010). Less is known about Openness to Experience, although here too there is suggestive evidence (
        Ferguson &amp; Bibby, 2012; 
        Turiano, Spiro, &amp; Mroczek, 2012).
      </p><a id="psp-106-3-484-EEDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_11" title="Moving From Prediction to Theory, and From Theory to Translation">Moving From Prediction to Theory, and From Theory to Translation</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Research has begun dissecting the personality processes underlying the Big Five factors in order to better understand the mechanisms by which personality “gets outside the skin” to affect morbidity and mortality (
        Hampson, 2012). Personality differences are theorized to affect health in several ways: First, personality differences may reflect underlying variation in biological systems linked to the pathogenesis of disease. Neuroticism, characterized by heightened emotional reactivity to environmental stimuli, has been tied to greater activation of neuroendocrine and immune systems (
        Lahey, 2009). Greater levels of Neuroticism could possibly reflect an underlying hyperresponsiveness to both emotional and physiological negative stimuli. Second, personality differences are thought to relate to the various ways in which people react to illness. This includes the variety of processes in which people cope with stress, seek medical care, adhere to treatment, and engage with others to receive support. For example, individuals higher in Extraversion may seek out more socially engaging environments allowing them to call on a richer network of social support when dealing with illness (
        Carver &amp; Connor-Smith, 2010). Third, personality differences are thought to be related to a wide range of health behaviors that either promote or mitigate disease. For example, individuals higher in Conscientiousness are more likely to live active lifestyles, have healthy diets, and refrain from smoking and excessive alcohol consumption (
        Bogg &amp; Roberts, 2004). These processes—disease pathogenesis, reaction to illness, and health behaviors—are not mutually exclusive and may work together to affect health outcomes.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">An upcoming special issue in 
        <em>Developmental Psychology</em> highlights the pressing need for implementation science to support personality���health research (
        Chapman, Hampson, &amp; Clarkin, in press; 
        Israel &amp; Moffitt, in press). To move forward in applying personality measurement in clinical settings requires the utmost confidence in the robustness of personality–health associations. One approach to examining robustness is meta-analysis; a recent report examining personality and all-cause mortality in seven cohorts and over 75,000 adults revealed that Conscientiousness was consistently associated with elevated mortality risk (
        Jokela et al., 2013). Although these results are certainly impressive, robust prediction should apply not only to a finding’s consistency across 
        <em>studies</em> but also to its consistency across measurement 
        <em>sources</em>. As an analogy, blood pressure readings yield similar prospective utility whether measured at home, by a friend, or at the clinic. How well does personality fare in predicting health when assessed by different reporters? We do not know. The overwhelming majority of personality research examining objective health outcomes has relied solely on self-reports. In this article, we use data from the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study (hereinafter referred to as the Study; 
        Moffitt, Caspi, Rutter, &amp; Silva, 2001) to test how well Big Five personality traits predict health when personality assessment is carried out by observers. We did this in two ways: First, we asked how well do personality measures predict health when personality is assessed by observers who know Study members well? To test this question, we used informant ratings of Study members’ personalities collected from their friends, family, and peers. Next, we asked how well do personality measures predict health when assessed by observers who 
        <em>do not</em> know Study members well? To test this question, we used Study member personality assessments completed by Dunedin Study staff members. Personality assessments by the Study nurse and receptionist were completed after brief encounters with Study members in the clinical data collection setting. These brief encounters and resulting judgments at zero acquaintance (by which we mean: “meeting for the first time”; 
        Hirschmüller, Egloff, Nestler, &amp; Back, 2013) are analogous to the type of interactions patients have with clinical and administrative staff in primary care settings.

We examined whether personality ratings ascertained when Study members were young adults would predict their health at age 38, as they entered midlife. Research focusing on the capacity of personality to predict objective measures such as disease and mortality has primarily focused on the second half of the life course. This leaves a gap in our understanding of whether personality predicts health in the first half of the life course, before the typical emergence of clinical problems. To capture the integrity of physical health across multiple systems, we constructed a composite index of poor physical health using clinical indicators across multiple domains, including metabolic abnormalities, cardiorespiratory fitness, pulmonary function, periodontal disease, and systemic inflammation. We evaluated the predictive utility of personality traits over and above other risk factors commonly assessed by doctors in primary care. These include factors such as Study members’ socioeconomic status, current health risks (smoking, obesity, medical conditions), self-reported health, and family history of disease. We also tested whether personality could predict whose health would deteriorate over time. The most powerful test in an observational study is whether prospectively measured personality can account for variation in subsequent within-individual health change. Accordingly, we tracked change in health using repeated measures of our index of physical health at age 26 and again at age 38.</p><a id="psp-106-3-484-ECDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_18" title="Method">Method</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><a id="psp-106-3-484-EGCDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Sample</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Participants in our study were members of the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study (

          Moffitt, Caspi, Rutter, &amp; Silva, 2001). The cohort represents the full range of socioeconomic status in the general population of New Zealand’s South Island and is primarily White. Assessments were carried out at birth and at ages 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 18, 21, 26, 32, and, most recently, 38 years, when 95% of the 1,007 Study members still alive took part. At each assessment wave, each Study member is brought to the Dunedin research unit for a full day of interviews and examinations.

Each scale was measured using five items. Informant data were obtained for 946 (96%) of the 980 Study members who participated in the age-26 assessment.

Staff ratings were made by the Study receptionist, who greeted each Study member and shepherded them through the assessment day, and by the Study nurse, who read each Study member’s blood pressure, recorded their medical history, and monitored their cardiorespiratory fitness during bicycle ergometry. Ratings were made based on a 20-item Big Five inventory (
          Norman, 1963). Nurse and receptionist ratings were collected for the first time at age 32. Each item consisted of a 7-point scale assessing a Big Five dimension: Extraversion (e.g., “talkative … silent”) (α = 0.86), Agreeableness (e.g., “friendly … suspicious, hostile”) (α = 0.81), Neuroticism (e.g., “calm … anxious”) (α = 0.74), Conscientiousness (e.g., “responsible … undependable”) (α = 0.82), and Openness to Experience (e.g., “open-minded … narrow”) (α = 0.83). Staff impression ratings of Study members’ personalities were made for 935 (97%) of the 960 Study members who participated in the age-32 assessment. Personality variables were standardized to the same scale using a

Staff were blind to the hypothesis that personality ratings could predict health.

          Mokdad, Marks, Stroup, &amp; Gerberding, 2004); (c) self-reported health was assessed using questionnaires commonly used in primary care, including global self-reported health, a report of physical functioning, and a checklist of current or past medical conditions; (d) family medical histories were gathered as part of the Dunedin Family Health History Study (
          Milne et al., 2008). Descriptions for each age-26 risk factor are provided in 
          Table 5. As expected, all these risk factors predicted poorer physical health at age 38 (see 
          Table 5; all 
          <em>p</em>s &lt; .05). Risk factors were used as covariates in our longitudinal analyses and also served the secondary function of providing effect size references against which to compare personality effects. Correlations between health risk factors and age-26 informant ratings of personality are shown in 
          Table 6.

          Gottfredson &amp; Deary, 2004) suggests that one way in which Openness to Experience may contribute to health is via its overlap with intelligence. We tested this hypothesis by adding information about IQ scores to our analysis. Study members with lower IQ scores were less open to experience (Pearson’s

          H. S. Friedman &amp; Booth-Kewley, 1987; 
          Lahey, 2009). One hypothesis is that Neuroticism is related to subjective health, but less strongly related to objective health (
          Costa &amp; McCrae, 1987; 
          Watson &amp; Pennebaker, 1989). We tested this by substituting the age-38 measure of clinically measured health with Study members’ global appraisals of their health at age 38 (
          Ware &amp; Sherbourne, 1992). In contrast to the nonsignificant associations between Neuroticism and objective health, higher Neuroticism was a significant predictor of poorer self-reported subjective health at age 38 (see

We recognize that acquiring informant reports from peers and family members who know an individual well may pose some practical challenges in primary-care settings. To address this issue, we examined whether personality ratings made by the Study nurse and receptionist—who had no prior acquaintance with Study members and only interacted with them during clinical data collection—yielded a similar pattern of results. Results from these secondary analyses provide an additional robustness test of health prediction from informant-based personality ratings.

Moreover, the effects of Conscientiousness and Openness to Experience on poor health were consistent across measurement source: Receptionist ratings and nurse ratings of Conscientiousness and Openness to Experience each predicted poor health at 38, and decline in health from age 26 to age 38 (see

This has fostered expectations that personalized health planning, informed by a patient’s “molecular” risk for disease and response to treatment, will soon be widely available (
        Evans, Meslin, Marteau, &amp; Caulfield, 2011). Realistically, the complexities of translating molecular targets into actionable medical guidelines mean that this goal is more distant than previously anticipated (
        Ioannidis, 2009). Here, we show that variation observed in young adults’ personality (i.e., their personality phenome) predicts health trajectories as they enter midlife. Five-item informant ratings of an individual’s Conscientiousness and Openness to Experience when Study members were young adults could foretell their physical health at age 38, adding incremental prognostic information even after accounting for measures routinely ascertained in primary care settings. Even more powerfully, informant ratings of Conscientiousness and Openness to Experience predicted decline in physical health over a 12-year period. Moreover, fleeting encounters with Study members provided enough of an impression for the Study nurse and receptionist to make personality assessments that provide prognostic value in predicting Study members’ health. These staff impressions of Conscientiousness and Openness to Experience at zero acquaintance yielded similar predictive utility as informant reports despite differences in Study member age at personality assessment and differences in the instrument used to measure the Big Five personality traits. Our findings suggest that integrating personality measurement into primary care may be an inexpensive and accessible way to identify which young adults are in need of their doctors’ attention to promote a healthy lifestyle while they are yet young, in time to prevent disease onset.
      </p><a id="psp-106-3-484-EDADA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Why Do Conscientiousness and Openness to Experience Predict Health?</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Several explanations may account for the association between Conscientiousness and health. Individuals high in Conscientiousness are more likely to engage in active lifestyles and maintain healthy diets (
          Bogg &amp; Roberts, 2004). They tend to be more future-oriented in their thinking, so are more likely to weigh the consequences of their actions for future health (
          Strathman, Gleicher, Boninger, &amp; Edwards, 1994). They also tend to exert higher levels of self-control, and so are less likely to smoke, abuse drugs or alcohol, or engage in health risk behaviors (
          Bogg &amp; Roberts, 2004), and are more likely to have successful careers and stable marriages, which are associated with positive health (
          Bogg &amp; Roberts, 2013). The processes through which Conscientiousness contributes to health take shape across the life course and are intertwined with individuals’ daily decisions to engage in activities that promote good health and mitigate health risks (
          Hampson, Andrews, Barckley, Lichtenstein, &amp; Lee, 2000; 
          Shanahan, Hill, Roberts, Eccles, &amp; Friedman, 2012).
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Previous studies have convincingly shown that self-reports of Conscientiousness predict health outcomes. Our analysis demonstrates that these associations are not dependent on the source of personality measurement. Third-party observers, both those who knew Study members well and those who did not, were able to rely solely on externally expressed cues to identify the characteristic features of an individual’s Conscientiousness in a manner that is predictive of health decline. In addition to bolstering the evidence base that individual differences in Conscientiousness are likely the most salient of the Big Five personality dimensions to contribute to overall health, our research also demonstrates that (at least in regards to predicting health) accurate measurement of Conscientiousness does not require privileged access to the self.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Openness to Experience, via its shared association with IQ, likely impacts health processes in a manner similar to intelligence (
          Gregory, Nettelbeck, &amp; Wilson, 2010). Our analysis suggests that assessing Openness to Experience may be a simple and accessible window into attributes of intelligence associated with future health risks. Accumulating research shows that low intelligence is linked to a broad array of health outcomes such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and all-cause mortality (
          Batty &amp; Deary, 2004; 
          Batty, Deary, &amp; Gottfredson, 2007; Deary et al., 2011), associations which remain after accounting for differences in socioeconomic status (
          Gottfredson &amp; Deary, 2004). People higher in intelligence are likely to have knowledge conducive to preventing age-related diseases; to seek medical attention once symptoms present; and to understand and adhere to complex regimens for management, control, and recovery after treatment begins (
          Batty &amp; Deary, 2004; 
          Beier &amp; Ackerman, 2003; 
          Gottfredson &amp; Deary, 2004).
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Importantly, Openness/Intellect ranks high in its degree of evaluativeness (
          John &amp; Robins, 1993); people typically do not like to consider themselves as narrow, crude, or unimaginative. Self-judgments of Openness/Intellect are therefore particularly susceptible to distortion from presentation biases. This may explain the mixed findings for Openness to Experience in predicting health outcomes when measured using self-reports. Previous research has suggested that observer reports may result in more accurate prediction of Openness to Experience/Intellect and result in more unique predictive validity (
          Vazire, 2010). Our analysis supports this assertion. In regards to health prediction, observer ratings of low Openness to Experience were consistently predictive of poorer physical health.
        </p><a id="psp-106-3-484-ECADA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">What About Neuroticism?</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The prospective utility of Neuroticism for predicting health outcomes is a matter of ongoing debate. There is broad consensus that Neuroticism predicts health complaints and health service use (
          B. Friedman, Veazie, Chapman, Manning, &amp; Duberstein, 2013; 
          Lahey, 2009). Our study confirms this finding using observer reports of Neuroticism. There is less consensus about whether Neuroticism predicts objectively measured health (
          Costa &amp; McCrae, 1987; 
          Watson &amp; Pennebaker, 1989). Whereas some studies have revealed an association between higher Neuroticism and increased morbidity and mortality (
          Shipley, Weiss, Der, Taylor, &amp; Deary, 2007; 
          Terracciano, Löckenhoff, Zonderman, Ferrucci, &amp; Costa, 2008; 
          Wilson et al., 2005), other studies have not (
          Jokela et al., 2013). In the present study, neither informant nor staff ratings consistently predicted objective poor health. These results should be interpreted in reference to research about what type of personality information is captured in observer ratings versus self-reports. Although observer reports rely on externally expressed cues, self-reports have privileged access to an individual’s thoughts and feelings. It has been argued that this distinction may result in asymmetry between self- and observer reports for traits such as Neuroticism (
          Vazire, 2010). We did not collect self-reports of Big Five personality traits, and so we could not compare health prediction between observer- and self-reports of personality directly. Although we demonstrate that observer ratings of personality predict future health, we do not rule out the potential of self-report measures to provide equally valuable inferences. Thus, although the association between Neuroticism and health appears less robust than Conscientiousness, the extent to which self-reports of Neuroticism predict objective health remains an open question.
        </p><a id="psp-106-3-484-EBADA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Limitations</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Our study has several limitations. First, we did not collect self-reports of Big Five personality and thus could not directly compare the predictive utility of observer ratings with self-report ratings. Rather, we relied on a substantial literature demonstrating links between self-reported personality and health to serve as the reference point for our examination of observer-reported personality and health.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Second, the personality effects we report are small, but these should be evaluated relative to other well-established risk factors for poor health. Notably, the contributions of Conscientiousness (IRR 0.91) and Openness to Experience (IRR 0.91) to future health are on par with the contributions of socioeconomic status, education, self-reported health, smoking, and family medical history (presented in 
          Table 5, right column).
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Third, the health outcomes we examined were right-censored at 38 years, our most recent assessment. Accordingly, we examined clinical indicators rather than endpoints such as cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and mortality. However, all of the clinical indicators reported here are well characterized and have prognostic utility as early warning measures for morbidity and mortality (
          Blair et al., 1996; 
          Danesh et al., 2000; 
          Eckel, Alberti, Grundy, &amp; Zimmet, 2010; 
          Rasmussen et al., 2002). Future analysis of the Dunedin cohort will also allow us to examine which personality traits are important for healthy aging later in life; for example, Extraversion and Agreeableness, linked to the development and maintenance of social support (
          Cohen, 2004; 
          Uchino, 2009), may promote health in later ages (
          Rosengren, Orth-Gomér, Wedel, &amp; Wilhelmsen, 1993; 
          Rozanski, Blumenthal, &amp; Kaplan, 1999). Neuroticism, linked to poorer subjective health, is a predictor of mortality in older ages even after accounting for objective health risks (
          Idler &amp; Benyamini, 1997; 
          Wilson, de Leon, Bienias, Evans, &amp; Bennett, 2004).
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Fourth, our study is limited to a cohort of individuals who were born in New Zealand in the 1970s, and who have access to socialized healthcare. The universality of the Big Five personality dimensions (
          Benet-Martínez &amp; John, 1998; 
          McCrae &amp; Terracciano, 2005) suggests that findings from New Zealand should apply to other countries and cultures. Further, it is possible that the associations we report here may be even more pronounced in countries where healthcare is less accessible and accessing it requires greater conscientious effort.
        </p><a id="psp-106-3-484-EAADA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Next Steps</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Healthcare reform in the United States is leading to a substantial increase in newly insured young adults (
          Sommers &amp; Kronick, 2012). This rapid increase presents a timely opportunity for healthcare professionals to encourage young adults to supplant the health risk behaviors of youth with health-promoting habits for midlife. However, clinical guidelines for preventive health in young adults are sparse, disorganized, and “can’t be found” (
          Ozer, Urquhart, Brindis, Park, &amp; Irwin, 2012). Our findings suggest that integrating personality measurement may help physicians and nurses anticipate which young adults will be at greater risk for developing poor health, in some cases before the presence of elevated clinical indicators. To address this goal, implementation research is needed to establish the cost, feasibility, and utility of integrating personality measurement into clinical practice (
          Ioannidis, 2009).
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We foresee three important areas of inquiry: First, research should examine whether self-reports or observer reports of personality are more appropriate in clinical settings. Self-reports have known social desirability biases, and such effects may be compounded if patients were to complete personality questionnaires knowing that the outcome could affect the type of medical treatment they would receive. Further, if confidentiality of personality ratings were not guaranteed, would reporters—self or other—be willing to be frank? We need research on acceptability to understand people’s willingness to provide personality data in real-world settings.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Second, implementation research also has the potential to advance personality theory. Research psychologists tend to think that theory guides implementation, but it is also the case that implementation can improve theory testing. Hospitals and care providers are beginning to link comprehensive records of health service use, lab tests, diagnoses, and drug prescriptions into centralized electronic systems that will capture the complexity of interaction with the health care system for large numbers of individuals. Adding personality measures to electronic infrastructures of health records could provide an invaluable data resource for researchers to examine how personality and health interact over time, in the real world. One such system, the National Institutes of Health-funded Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS), makes use of brief self-report metrics to help clinicians and researchers design treatment plans and improve communication (
          Cella et al., 2010). Personality measures are not currently in the PROMIS questionnaire bank; the present findings provide impetus for testing these measures’ translational potential.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Third, personality measurement may improve communication and collaboration between patients and health care professionals by making professionals more aware of each patient’s personal lifestyle preferences. Research shows that such patient-centered approaches improve delivery of preventive services and the management of chronic conditions (
          Starfield &amp; Shi, 2004; 
          Starfield, Shi, &amp; Macinko, 2005). Randomized controlled trials should be conducted in which health care providers either have access to personality information or not. Does personality information produce improved patient outcomes?
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Our research also has implications for public health. There is ongoing debate about how to address behavioral risk factors for chronic disease, such as sedentary lifestyle, smoking, and poor diet. Our findings suggest that interventions requiring effortful planning, self-control, and strict adherence are less likely to be effective for segments of the population in which these psychological resources are in shortest supply (i.e., individuals low in Conscientiousness). In contrast, strategically tailoring messages to individuals low in Conscientiousness may increase the appeal of health-promotion communication, and the effectiveness of health-promotion interventions (
          Conrod et al., 2013; 
          Hirsh, Kang, &amp; Bodenhausen, 2012). In addition, programs that manipulate choice architecture to increase the likelihood of healthy decision making may produce particular benefits for those individuals whose lack of Conscientiousness otherwise works against their health (
          Downs, Loewenstein, &amp; Wisdom, 2009; 
          Marteau, Ogilvie, Roland, Suhrcke, &amp; Kelly, 2011; 
          Thaler &amp; Sunstein, 2008). More broadly, our findings suggest that in addition to the “what” of chronic age-related diseases—the specific behaviors and pathophysiology that cause illness—preventive medicine may also benefit from attending to the “who”—characteristic differences in personality—in order to design effective interventions.
