People hold naive theories that their responsive behavior elicits positive sentiments from others, such as satisfaction, positive regard, and commitment, and they believe their unresponsive behavior elicits negative sentiments. Accordingly, 2 dyadic behavioral observation studies, one involving conflict interactions (Study 1) and one involving support interactions (Study 2), suggested that people who value partners achieve security that they are valued by their partners through both accurate and biased self-perceptions of responsive behavior. Perceivers who valued partners accurately perceived their more responsive behavior enacted toward partners, which bolstered their confidence that they were valued by partners (accurate self-perception). In addition, perceivers who valued partners had biased and exaggerated perceptions of their own responsive behavior, which also bolstered their perceptions of being valued by partners (biased self-perception). Examination of memories of responsive behavior 2 weeks and 6 months following interactions (Study 2) suggested that perceivers’ memories of their own responsive behavior derived from a mix of accuracy and bias, which predicted changes in relationship security over time. These findings underscore the importance of perceivers’ representations of their responsive behavior, both accurate and biased, as determinants of their own relationship security.

        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">When people want a close, communal relationship with a particular partner and have strong pro-relationship motivations, as suggested by their strong relationship commitment (
        Rusbult &amp; Buunk, 1993), care for the partner’s welfare (
        Mills, Clark, Ford, &amp; Johnson, 2004), or positive regard for the partner (
        Murray, Holmes, &amp; Griffin, 2000), they usually want the partner to reciprocate these sentiments (
        Clark, Dubash, &amp; Mills, 1998; 
        Holmes &amp; Rempel, 1989; 
        Lemay, Clark, &amp; Feeney, 2007; 
        Wieselquist, Rusbult, Foster, &amp; Agnew, 1999). This reciprocation facilitates goals to maintain the relationship and satisfies evolved needs to forge stable and caring bonds (
        Baumeister &amp; Leary, 1995). When partners do not reciprocate, these positive sentiments toward partners can exacerbate pain and loss (
        Lemay, Overall, &amp; Clark, 2012; 
        Murray, Holmes, &amp; Collins, 2006; 
        Wieselquist et al., 1999), leading many people to feel increasingly vulnerable as they become more attached (
        Murray et al., 2006). Hence, people must manage the vulnerability that co-occurs with their attachments and achieve a sense that these valued partners reciprocate their positive sentiments, and they often adopt a variety of cognitive and behavioral strategies to meet these goals. The current research examines novel intrapersonal processes that routinely assist people who value partners in generating confidence that they are valued in return. These processes involve the perception that one has enacted responsive behavior toward partners. One of the strongest predictors of relationship closeness, satisfaction, and longevity is the perception that partners are responsive to one’s needs, including feeling understood, valued, and cared for by partners (
        Gable, Gonzaga, &amp; Strachman, 2006; 
        Lemay et al., 2007; 
        Murray et al., 2000; 
        Reis, Clark, &amp; Holmes, 2004). Hence, perceivers may feel more secure that they are valued by partners when they enact (and believe they enact) responsive behavior toward partners. A guiding model is presented in 
        Figure 1, and the model paths are described in detail below.

They may believe this, in part, because they actually do enact these behaviors. Indeed, a number of investigations using relatively objective indicators of behavior suggest that perceivers with these positive sentiments toward their partners do behave in more responsive ways toward their partners (e.g., 
        Collins &amp; Feeney, 2000; 
        Feeney &amp; Collins, 2001; 
        Gill, Christensen, &amp; Fincham, 1999; 
        Mills et al., 2004; 
        Weiss &amp; Heyman, 1990). This effect of perceivers’ valuing of partners on their actual responsive behavior toward partners is represented by Path A in 
        Figure 1. In turn, with some self-awareness, perceivers who behave in a responsive manner toward their partners are likely to be aware that they behaved in this way. In other words, perceivers’ perceptions of their own responsive behavior may be partially accurate. The effect of perceivers’ responsive behavior on their perceptions of that behavior is represented as Path B in 
        Figure 1. Consistent with this hypothesized path, a number of studies on accuracy of self-assessments suggest that self-perceptions of behavior have a kernel of truth, as demonstrated by significant associations of self-perceived behavior with judgments made by acquaintances, experts, and objective observers (
        Gosling, John, Craik, &amp; Robins, 1998; 
        Hall, Murphy, &amp; Mast, 2007; 
        John &amp; Robins, 1994; 
        Kolar, Funder, &amp; Colvin, 1996; 
        Vazire &amp; Mehl, 2008; for a review, see 
        Vazire &amp; Carlson, 2010). The current research extends this work, most of which has examined accuracy with regard to self-perceptions of personality, to examine accuracy of self-perceptions of interpersonal responsiveness within interactions with romantic partners.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Taken together, these two paths constitute an indirect effect of perceivers’ chronic valuing of their partners on their perceptions of their own responsive behavior via their actual behavior (Path A × B). In other words, perceivers who value relationships with partners perceive that they enacted responsive behavior partially because these perceivers do, in fact, enact responsive behavior and, to some extent, accurately perceive that they have done so. When Jack has strong feelings of satisfaction, care, or commitment toward Jill, he may treat Jill in a warm or supportive manner and accurately recognize that he behaved in this way.</p><a id="psp-107-4-638-EGDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_10" title="Path C: Bias in Perceptions of Own Responsive Behavior">Path C: Bias in Perceptions of Own Responsive Behavior</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Although perceptions of own responsive behavior may be partially accurate, perceivers’ self-perceptions of enacting responsive behavior toward partners also may be biased by their sentiments toward partners. This effect is represented as Path C in 
        Figure 1. Independently of how they actually behaved, perceivers with positive thoughts and feelings about partners may believe that they behaved in a responsive manner toward partners, whereas perceivers with negative thoughts and feelings may believe that they behaved in an unresponsive manner toward partners. In other words, perceivers with pro-relationship thoughts, feelings, or motivations may give themselves “extra credit” for having these sentiments when evaluating their own behavior. Given that outsiders lack insight into perceivers’ motivations or feelings, perceivers may not get this bonus when their behavior is evaluated by outsiders. As a result, this bias may lead perceivers to exaggerate their own responsive behavior relative to how it is perceived by others. Similar processes have been demonstrated in other domains. For example, self-perceptions of morality and achievement are biased by perceivers’ aspirations and intentions, leading perceivers with good intentions and lofty aspirations to evaluate their own behavior more generously relative to how they are perceived by outsiders (see 
        Helzer &amp; Dunning, 2012; 
        Kruger &amp; Gilovich, 2004). The current research tests whether similar biases extend to the domain of interpersonal responsiveness toward romantic partners.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The operation of this bias would suggest that people perceive their own behavior toward partners in a manner that is consistent with their preexisting thoughts and feelings about partners. Hence, this bias is termed a 
        <em>confirmation bias</em> in the current research. Confirmation biases occur when perceivers’ cognitive processes operate in ways that produce conclusions that are consistent with perceivers’ existing beliefs (
        Nickerson, 1998). Perceivers may have confirmation-biased perceptions of their own behavior for both cognitive and motivational reasons. In general, people have richer, more accessible, and more distinctive representations of their own subjective thoughts, feelings, and motivations relative to their own observable behavior (
        Andersen, Glassman, &amp; Gold, 1998; 
        Jones &amp; Nisbett, 1971). As a result, perceivers’ sentiments may act as a powerful anchor when they try to discern their behavior, such that perceptions of their own responsive behavior toward partners conform to their sentiments toward partners. That is, when Jack infers how he behaved toward Jill, he may assume he treated her with warmth and kindness because his own positive feelings about Jill are very clear to him, whereas the data he has on his own behavior are relatively impoverished, and therefore his behavior is easily confused with his sentiments. However, other people do not have access to Jack’s internal experiences. Therefore, Jack’s behavior is unlikely to be perceived as positively through others’ eyes.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">These biased perceptions of behavior also may arise as a result of motivations to maintain consistency in beliefs about the self (see 
        Aronson, 1999; 
        Swann, Griffin, Predmore, &amp; Gaines, 1987; 
        Swann &amp; Read, 1981). People with well-defined and importantly held self-perceptions readily generate behavioral evidence that supports their self-perceptions, and they tend to resist contradictory information (
        Greenwald, 1980; 
        Markus, 1977; 
        Swann &amp; Ely, 1984). They also selectively attend to information that confirms existing self-beliefs, recall information that is consistent with these beliefs, and interpret information in a manner that maintains these beliefs (
        Beyer, 1990; 
        Beyer &amp; Bowden, 1997; 
        Greenwald &amp; Pratkanis, 1984; 
        Nickerson, 1998; 
        Shrauger, 1975; 
        Swann, 1987). These processes may occur with regard to perceptions of enacting responsive behavior in romantic relationships. When perceivers perceive themselves as caring for their partner, having positive regard or feelings for the partner, or being committed to the partner, they may strive to see their behavior as consistent with this relational sense of self (see 
        Andersen &amp; Chen, 2002).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Moreover, perceivers who highly value partners may perceive that they behaved in a responsive manner toward partners as a way of bolstering their perception that they have contributed to maintaining a high-quality and stable relationship. Indeed, the operation of other biases in perceiving relationships suggests that perceivers are motivated to hold positive perceptions of relationships they care about (
        Lemay et al., 2007; 
        Lemay &amp; Neal, 2013; 
        Murray, Holmes, &amp; Griffin, 1996; 
        Rusbult, Lange, Wildschut, Yovetich, &amp; Verette, 2000; 
        Simpson, Ickes, &amp; Blackstone, 1995). That is, when a caring and committed Jack infers how he behaved toward Jill, he may assume he treated her with warmth and kindness because this conclusion contributes to desired experiences of self-consistency and relationship maintenance.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">How could this bias exist if research suggests that self-perceptions are accurate, as described above? Research on accuracy of self-knowledge suggests that accuracy accounts for only modest amounts of variance in self-perceptions of behavior (
        Hall et al., 2007; 
        Vazire &amp; Carlson, 2010), and many studies suggest that self-perceptions of behavior or personality can be less accurate than judgments made by other people (e.g., 
        Gosling et al., 1998; 
        John &amp; Robins, 1994; 
        Kolar et al., 1996; 
        Vazire &amp; Mehl, 2008). Self-perceptions of behavior seem especially low in accuracy when the behaviors are related to the domain of agreeableness (
        Gosling et al., 1998), which involves qualities such as kind, sympathetic, warm, compassionate, and helpful. This domain overlaps with interpersonal responsiveness, suggesting that self-perceptions of responsive behavior may also be low in accuracy. Hence, accuracy effects may be sufficiently modest to allow for the coexistence of bias. Notably, the large body of work on accuracy and bias in self-perceptions of behavior has tended to ignore the context of close interpersonal relationships, and it has overlooked the possibly important role of perceivers’ sentiments toward partners and pro-relationship motivations in shaping their perception of enacting interpersonally important behaviors, such as responsiveness. The current research fills these gaps.
      </p><a id="psp-107-4-638-EFDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_17" title="Path D: Implications of Perceptions of Responsive Behavior for Perceivers’ Relationship Security">Path D: Implications of Perceptions of Responsive Behavior for Perceivers’ Relationship Security</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Perceivers’ perceptions of their responsive behavior may shape their security in partners’ sentiments (see Path D in 
        Figure 1). Perceivers may have naive theories that their responsive behavior elicits positive sentiments in their partners, whereas their unresponsive behavior elicits negative sentiments. Consistent with this argument, a preliminary study found that people strongly believe that their responsive behavior elicits satisfaction, commitment, and positive regard from others, whereas their unresponsive behavior elicits reduced satisfaction, reduced commitment, and negative regard from others. These theories may be rooted in actual experience, as responsiveness does tend to elicit more positive sentiments in others (
        Clark &amp; Lemay, 2010; 
        Reis et al., 2004). Given the existence of such theories, perceivers who judge their own behavior as responsive may infer their partners’ high satisfaction, positive regard, and commitment, and perceivers who judge their own behavior as unresponsive may believe that partners now harbor more negative sentiments. This may be the case even when partners do not actually have these reactions, as perceivers’ perception that they enacted particular behaviors may be sufficient for them to infer a corresponding response in their partner. Perceivers may focus too much on their own behavior and neglect other pertinent information (see 
        Gilovich, Medvec, &amp; Savitsky, 2000; 
        Savitsky, Epley, &amp; Gilovich, 2001). For example, overly focused on his own generosity, Jack may assume that Jill feels satisfied with him after he buys her a gift.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">This prediction is consistent with self-perception theory, which posits that people reflect on their own behavior to infer their qualities (
        Bem, 1972). Similarly, perceivers may reflect on their own behavior to discern how their partners feel about them (see 
        Kenny &amp; DePaulo, 1993), and such inferences should be most proximally driven by perceivers’ perceptions of their behavior, whether accurate or biased. Prior research has not examined whether accurate and biased self-perceptions of behavior have implications for relationship security. However, some studies are consistent with this view. Studies that have manipulated perceivers’ behavior toward targets have demonstrated that perceivers feel more secure in targets’ positive regard and attraction when perceivers were instructed to behave in a prosocial manner toward targets than when they were instructed to behave in neutral or cold ways (
        Albright, Forest, &amp; Reiseter, 2001; 
        Lemay &amp; Clark, 2008). In addition, 
        Clark and Grote (1998) argued that, when people enact behaviors to meet the needs of their partner, they should feel that they have strengthened their relationship, which should make them feel more secure in their partner’s future responsiveness. In other words, people perceive their own responsive behavior, which then gives them reason to believe that they bolstered their partner’s care. The current research is the first to test such a process, and it adds that the perceptions of responsive behavior that drive this inference may be accurate or biased.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The hypothesized effect of perceivers’ self-perceptions of behavior on their relationship security implies two indirect pathways, one via accurate self-perception and one via biased self-perception, through which perceivers who value partners foster their own relationship security. First, perceivers’ who value partners may actually enact responsive behaviors. These behaviors may bolster their relationship security because, to some extent, perceivers accurately perceive that they were responsive, which gives them confidence that they are valued by partners (the A × B × D indirect effect in 
        Figure 1). This effect depends on perceivers accurately perceiving their own behavior and then making an inference about how this behavior affected their partners. Second, perceivers who value partners may overestimate their responsive behavior through the confirmation bias described earlier, and these biased perceptions of responsive behavior may then give perceivers reason to feel confident that partners value them (the C × D indirect effect in 
        Figure 1). This effect depends on perceivers having biased perceptions of their own behavior and then, again, inferring how this perceived behavior affected their partners. An objective of the current research was to test for the operation of these security-maintenance processes. Prior research has not demonstrated that perceivers who value partners bolster their relationship security through such processes.

Several findings suggest that perceivers tend to remember their pasts in ways that are consistent with their current motives, knowledge, or attitudes (e.g., 
        Greenwald, 1980; 
        Ross, 1989; 
        Sanitioso, Kunda, &amp; Fong, 1990). Especially relevant to the current research are findings suggesting that people exhibit a consistency effect when recalling their sentiments about their romantic partner, exaggerating the extent to which their prior feelings of liking and love for their partner were consistent with their current sentiments (
        McFarland &amp; Ross, 1987). Similarly, perceivers may have biased memories regarding their own responsive behavior. Perceivers may remember their behavior as being consistent with their sentiments about their partner. In turn, memories of being responsive to partners may give them confidence that they are valued by their partners.

        Figure 1 within the context of romantic relationships. This model was examined in the context of conflict interactions in Study 1 and that of social support interactions in Study 2. Both contexts are relevant to feelings of relationship security and have the capacity of evoking responsive behavior. In Study 2, the model was extended to memory.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Perceiver’s chronic valuing of partners was assessed with several indicators, including positive regard for partners, satisfaction with partners, commitment to relationships with partners, and care for partners’ welfare. Each of these constructs reflects positive evaluations or motivations regarding maintaining close bonds with partners, and these constructs have been associated with other security-enhancing processes in prior research (e.g., 
        Johnson &amp; Rusbult, 1989; 
        Lemay et al., 2007; 
        Lemay &amp; Melville, 2014; 
        Lemay &amp; Neal, 2013; 
        Rusbult et al., 2000; 
        Wieselquist et al., 1999; 
        Yoo, Clark, Lemay, Salovey, &amp; Monin, 2011).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Testing the model described above requires the separate measurement of perceivers’ perceptions of their behavior and perceivers’ actual behavior. There is no single perfect method of measuring actual behavior, especially with regard to complex behaviors such as interpersonal responsiveness. Hence, two indicators were used to measure perceivers’ actual behavior, including romantic partners’ reports of perceivers’ behavior and judgments of perceivers’ behavior made by a team of objective observers. These two indicators have distinct advantages. Partners’ perceptions of perceivers’ behavior may capture perceivers’ responsiveness that is understood only between the two partners, given their unique relationship history and shared understanding, which cannot be detected by outsider observers (
        Collins &amp; Feeney, 2000). However, judgments by objective observers have the advantage of being relatively immune to the positivity biases that may pervade partners’ judgments of their relationships (
        Lemay et al., 2007; 
        Murray et al., 1996). Moreover, both of these indicators have a history of being used as accuracy benchmarks in research on accuracy of self-assessments (e.g., 
        Gosling et al., 1998; 
        Hall et al., 2007; 
        John &amp; Robins, 1994; 
        Kolar et al., 1996; 
        Robins &amp; Beer, 2001; 
        Vazire &amp; Mehl, 2008).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The current research focuses on cognitive processes that bolster perceivers’ relationship security. However, relationship security also may be bolstered by interpersonal processes involving reactions from partners. When perceivers enact responsive behaviors toward partners, partners may respond with more positive relationship sentiments. In turn, perceivers may detect that partners have these positive sentiments. Consistent with this theorized process, a number of studies suggest that responsive behavior elicits partners’ positive relationship sentiments, which are detected (e.g., 
        Feeney &amp; Collins, 2003; 
        Gable, Reis, Impett, &amp; Asher, 2004; 
        Lemay et al., 2007; 
        Reis et al., 2004; 
        Wieselquist et al., 1999). Given that it could serve as an alternative explanation for some of the predicted effects, statistical analyses controlled for partners’ actual sentiments after the interaction.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Prior research suggests that people with high trait self-esteem are especially likely to exhibit self-enhancement biases (
        Brown, Collins, &amp; Schmidt, 1988; 
        Brown, Dutton, &amp; Cook, 2001; 
        Campbell, 1986; 
        Tice, 1991). In contrast, the model tested in the current research proposes that positive sentiments toward the partner, rather than toward the self, drive exaggeration of one’s responsive behavior. To test this notion and to be sure that self-esteem does not function as a third variable, self-esteem was measured and controlled in both studies.

Participants were asked to independently generate three to five issues that were a source of significant and unresolved conflict in their relationship with their partner. Using the lists generated by both couple members, the couple members jointly identified the most significant unresolved problem. The researcher then instructed the couples to discuss this issue, giving them the following instructions: “Remember what you were arguing about and why you were upset with your partner. Remember what you were thinking about and how you felt during the argument. After remembering these things, we would like each of you to tell the other what is it about his or her attitudes, habits, or behaviors that bothers you.” Participants were given 10 minutes to discuss the issue with their partner while being recorded. After the interaction, participants returned to separate rooms and completed an additional questionnaire containing the post-interaction measures described below. They were then fully debriefed.

However, this data set involved interchangeable dyads (as described below, gender did not play a strong moderating role), and so all participants provided data for both “perceiver” and “partner” variables. These labels are used only to clarify the nature of the effects being modeled. Data analysis proceeded in the following manner: First, analyses were conducted to examine whether perceivers who valued partners exaggerated their own responsive behavior relative to the index of their actual behavior (the aggregate perception of perceivers’ behavior by partners and observers). Second, a path model examined accuracy and bias in perceivers’ perceptions of their own responsive behavior, as well as implications of accuracy and bias for change in perceivers’ relationship security. Finally, alternative explanations for these effects were examined.

To answer this question, we tested simultaneous linear equations using the AMOS program (see 
            Murray et al., 2000). The model estimated two equations, one examining the effects of perceivers’ valuing of partners on their own responsive behavior (as perceived by partners and observers) and one examining the effect of perceivers’ valuing of partners on their perceptions of their own responsive behavior. Slopes and intercepts were estimated for each equation and were constrained to be equal across male and female partners.
            <a id="b-fn2"> </a><sup />Figure 2 presents both regression equations. As indicated in this figure, perceivers’ valuing of partners predicted perceivers’ perceptions of their own responsive behavior (
            <em>b</em> = .64) more strongly than it predicted the index of perceivers’ actual responsive behavior (
            <em>b</em> = .32). A nested chi-square test confirmed that constraining these two regression slopes to be equal resulted in a significant decrement in model fit, χ
            <sup>2</sup>(1) = 14.04, 
            <em>p</em> &lt; .001, suggesting that these associations are indeed different. Hence, perceivers’ sentiments did seem to predict their subjective perceptions of their behavior more than it predicted their actual behavior (as outsiders perceived it). As demonstrated in 
            Figure 2, the gap between perceivers’ perceptions of their responsive behavior and the index of their actual behavior increased along with increases in perceivers’ valuing of partners, suggesting that perceivers who valued partners were more likely to exaggerate their responsive behavior. In other words, perceivers seemed to give themselves more “credit” for their positive sentiments when evaluating their own behavior than did outsiders.

Given that gender differences were not significant, coefficients were pooled across male and female partners through the use of equality constraints. A residual approach was used to create an index of perceivers’ post-discussion relationship security that was independent of their chronic security and partners’ actual sentiments, although all effects described below were replicated when raw relationship security scores were used instead of residual scores. Perceivers’ post-discussion relationship security was regressed on perceivers’ chronic relationship security measured before the interaction and partners’ post-discussion sentiments toward perceivers. The unstandardized residuals from this analysis were saved and used as an index of change in perceivers’ relationship security.

The significant positive coefficient indicates that perceivers behaved in a more responsive manner, as judged by partners and observers, when they valued their partners, consistent with expectations. In turn, Path B represents an effect of perceivers’ responsive behavior on perceiver’s perceptions of that behavior. The significant positive coefficient for this path indicates accuracy: Perceivers perceived that they enacted responsive behavior when they did, in fact, enact responsive behavior (according to partners and observers). Path C represents the direct effect of perceivers’ valuing of partners on perceivers’ perceptions of their own behavior, which was significant. Independently of perceivers’ behavior as observers and partners saw it, perceivers who valued partners believed that they enacted more responsive behavior. This effect supports predictions of a confirmation bias in perceivers’ judgments of their own responsive behavior.

Consistent findings were produced in analyses that modeled the two indicators of perceivers’ behavior (observers’ perceptions and partners’ perceptions) as separate predictors.

            <em>p</em> &lt; .001). In addition, consistent findings were produced in analyses that examined only one of the indicators of perceivers’ chronic valuing of their partners. Evidence that perceivers’ valuing of partners biased perceivers’ perceptions of their own behavior (Path C) was found when valuing of partners was operationalized as care for partners (
            <em>b</em> = .40,

Likewise, evidence that perceivers’ perceptions of their own behavior predicted change in their relationship security (Path D) was found when the composite index of change in perceivers’ relationship security was replaced with one of its constituents. Evidence was sound predicting post-interaction perceived partner satisfaction (
            <em>b</em> = .19, 
            <em>p</em> &lt; .001), post-interaction perceived regard (

As indicated in

The indirect effect of perceivers’ valuing of partners on their self-perceived behavior via their actual behavior (the combination of Paths A and B) also was significant. This indicates that perceivers who valued partners saw themselves as enacting more responsive behavior toward those partners partly because these perceivers actually did enact responsive behavior, which they accurately perceived. In other words, accurate self-perception of behavior was one mechanism that explained why perceivers who valued partners saw themselves as more responsive toward those partners. Taken together with the confirmation bias direct effect, these results suggest that both accurate and biased self-perception can explain why perceivers who value partners see themselves as more responsive. Approximately 78% of the total effect of perceivers’ chronic valuing on perceivers’ perceptions of their own behavior was direct, which suggests confirmation bias, whereas 22% of the total effect was indirect, via accurate assessment of their own behavior.

The significant total effect suggests that, via a combination of the indirect effects, perceivers who valued partners felt significantly more secure that they were valued by partners following the interaction. The indirect effect involving a combination of Paths C and D is central to whether confirmation-biased self-perceptions of behavior predict perceivers’ security. As indicated in 
              Table 1, this C × D indirect path was significant. This indirect path suggests that perceivers who valued partners tended to perceive that they engaged in responsive behavior toward those partners, which made them feel more confident that they were valued by partners, and this process occurred independently of perceivers’ actual behavior (as indexed by observers and partners) and partners’ actual sentiments. This process accounted for 78% of the overall effect of perceivers’ valuing of partners on changes in their relationship security. The indirect effect involving a combination of Paths A, B, and D suggests that perceivers who valued partners enacted responsive behavior and, after recognizing their own behavior as responsive, they felt more secure in partners’ sentiments.

              <em>p</em> &lt; .001). Independently of this effect, perceivers’ change in their valuing of partners strongly predicted change in relationship security (

The original model proposed that self-perceptions of responsive behavior fully mediated effects of perceivers’ valuing of partners and perceivers’ behavior on perceivers’ change in felt security. The alternative model switched the mediator and outcome, positing that perceivers’ change in felt security fully mediated effects of perceivers’ valuing of partners and perceivers’ behavior on perceivers’ perceptions of their behavior. This model was not a good fit to the data, χ

Even after controlling for perceivers’ change in felt security, perceivers’ valuing of partners and perceivers’ responsive behavior continued to predict their perceptions of responsive behavior (
              <em>b</em> = .45 and 
              <em>b</em> = .31, respectively, 
              <em>p</em> &lt; .001). In summary, then, evidence for full mediation was found in the original model but not in an alternative model that switched the status of the mediator and outcome variables.

          Figure 1. Perceivers who valued partners enacted more responsive behavior, as judged by outsiders. Perceivers’ judgments of their own responsive behavior were both accurate (based on their actual behavior) and biased (predicted by their sentiments toward partners). Perceivers who valued partners seemed to give themselves extra credit for having pro-relationship sentiments toward partners when they judged their own responsive behavior, resulting in exaggeration of their responsive behavior. In turn, accurate self-perception of behavior and biased self-perception of behavior had independent effects on perceivers’ security following the interaction, revealing new processes by which perceivers who value partners generate relationship security. These processes appeared to operate independently of perceivers’ chronic feelings of relationship security and partners’ actual sentiments following the interaction.

However, the model was tested in the context of an observed social support interaction rather than a conflict interaction, potentially expanding the applicability of the model. In each dyad, a randomly selected individual (“partner”) was asked to describe a personal stressor, providing an opportunity for this individual’s romantic partner (“perceiver”) to provide responsive support. In addition to reporting on their immediate perceptions, perceivers reported on their memories of their behavior 2 weeks and 6 months following the interaction. These data were used to test whether the model could be extended to perceivers’ memories of their responsive behavior.

To assist participants with feeling comfortable in the presence of the video cameras, the researcher had them play a game for five minutes. Then, the researcher asked partners to discuss the problem they identified earlier. The researcher then left the room for 7 minutes, or until one of the participants notified the researcher that the discussion was over.

          <em>perceivers</em> to refer to participants who were in the support-provider role (i.e., listening to a partner talk about a problem) and who made judgments of their own responsive behavior. The term 
          <em>partners</em> will be used to refer to their romantic partners, who were in a support-seeker role (i.e., describing their problem). Data analysis was analogous to the analysis presented in Study 1, and all analyses were path analyses conducted with the AMOS program. First, analyses were conducted to examine whether perceivers who value partners exaggerate their own responsive behavior relative to the index of their actual behavior (the aggregate perception of perceivers’ behavior by partners and observers). Second, path analysis tested the model displayed in 
          Figure 1, and alternative explanations of these effects were addressed. Finally, extensions of the model to memory and long-term changes in relationship security were tested.

The model estimated the effects of perceivers’ valuing of partners on perceivers’ own responsive behavior toward partners (as perceived by partners and observers) and on perceivers’ perceptions of their own responsive behavior. The model estimated a slope and intercept for each of these equations. 
            Figure 4 presents predicted values from both regression equations. Consistent with predictions, the slope linking perceivers’ valuing of partners to their perceptions of their responsive behavior was stronger (
            <em>b</em> = .54) than the slope linking perceivers’ valuing of partners to the index of perceivers’ actual responsive behavior (
            <em>b</em> = .30). A nested chi-square test indicated that these slopes were significantly different, χ

            Figure 4, the gap between perceivers’ perceptions of their responsive behavior and the index of their actual behavior increased along with increases in perceivers’ valuing of partners, suggesting greater exaggeration of responsive behavior for perceivers who highly valued partners. Consistent with findings from Study 1, these results suggest that perceivers gave themselves more “credit” for their positive sentiments when evaluating their behavior than did outsiders or that perceivers tended to confuse their behavior with their positive sentiments.

As was the case in Study 1, a residual approach was used to create an index of perceivers’ post-discussion relationship security that was independent of their chronic security and partners’ actual sentiments, although all effects described below were replicated when raw scores were used in place of the residual index. Perceivers’ post-discussion relationship security (i.e., average of perceived partner satisfaction, commitment, and acceptance following the interaction) was regressed on perceivers’ chronic relationship security measured before the interaction (i.e., average of perceived partner satisfaction, commitment, and acceptance; Cronbach’s α = .72) and partners’ post-discussion sentiments toward perceivers (average of partners’ satisfaction and commitment; Cronbach’s α = .90). The unstandardized residuals from this analysis were used as an index of change in perceivers’ relationship security. Positive residuals suggest that perceivers felt more secure following the interaction than what could be predicted on the basis of their preinteraction security or on the basis of their partner’s actual sentiments following the interaction.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The model paths and unstandardized coefficients are presented in 
            Figure 5. Path A was significant, which indicates that perceivers who valued partners engaged in more responsive behavior toward those partners, as judged by partners and observers. Path B also was significant, which indicates that perceivers who engaged in responsive behavior accurately perceived, to some extent, that they engaged in responsive behavior. The direct effect of perceivers’ chronic valuing on their perceptions of responsive behavior, Path C, also was significant. Suggesting a confirmation bias in perceptions of behavior, perceivers who valued partners believed that they enacted more responsive behavior, and this effect was independent of what observers and partners perceived. Once again, these results suggest a blend of both accuracy and bias in perceivers’ perceptions of their own responsive behavior. Perceptions of behavior were tied to the indicator of perceivers’ actual behavior, but they were also predicted by perceivers’ sentiments about partners. Path D was significant, which suggests that perceivers who believed they enacted responsive behavior felt more secure regarding partners’ sentiments.
            <a id="b-fn8"> </a><sup /> Given that the residual index of change in perceivers’ security was used in this analysis, this effect cannot be explained by perceiver’s chronic relationship security or the partner’s actual sentiments following the interaction.

            <em>b</em> = .29,

            <em>p</em> &lt; .001). In addition, evidence that perceivers’ valuing of partners biased perceivers’ perceptions of their own behavior (Path C) was found when valuing of partners was operationalized as care for partners (

Evidence that perceivers’ perceptions of their own behavior predicted change in their relationship security was found when the composite index of perceivers’ change in relationship security was replaced with one of its constituents, instead predicting perceived partner satisfaction (

That it was significant suggests that perceivers’ valuing of partners had a significant overall effect, summed across all possible pathways, on perceivers’ perceptions of their own behavior. The significant direct effect, as described above, indicates confirmation-bias: Independently of perceivers’ actual behavior, perceivers who valued partners seemed biased to perceive that they were responsive toward partners. This effect accounted for 72% of the overall effect of perceivers’ valuing of partners on their self-perceptions of responsive behavior. The indirect effect involving the combination of Paths A and B was significant, which reflects a tendency for perceivers who valued partners to perceive that they enacted responsive behavior because they did, in fact, enact responsive behavior. In other words, accurate self-perception partly accounted for why perceivers who valued partners perceived that they behaved in a responsive manner. Approximately 28% of the overall effect was indirect, via perceivers’ accurate assessment of their own behavior.

The indirect effect involving the combination of Paths C and D was significant, which suggests that confirmation-biased self-perceptions of behavior predicted change in perceivers’ security. That is, this indirect path suggests that perceivers who valued partners assumed that they engaged in responsive behavior toward those partners (independently of their actual behavior), which bolstered their confidence that they were valued by partners following the interaction. This process accounted for approximately 71% of the overall effect of perceivers’ valuing of partners on change in their security. The indirect effect involving a combination of Paths A, B, and D also was significant, indicating that perceivers who valued targets enacted responsive behavior and that they felt more secure in partners’ sentiments because they correctly perceived that they had enacted this behavior.

              <sup>2</sup>(8) = 29.60, RMSEA = .24, NNFI = 0. A saturated model revealed why: Even after we controlled for perceivers’ change in felt security, perceivers’ valuing of partners and perceivers’ responsive behavior continued to predict their perceptions of responsive behavior (
              <em>b</em> = .36 and 
              <em>b</em> = .50, respectively, 
              <em>p</em> &lt; .001). Hence, evidence for full mediation was found in the original model but not in an alternative model that switched the status of the mediator and outcome variables.

The model is depicted in 
            Figure 6. One model was constructed to predict T2 (2 weeks later) memories, and another was constructed to predict T3 (6 months later) memories. Paths A, B, and C are conceptually identical to the paths described in 
            Figure 5. Perceivers’ T2 or T3 memories of their responsive behavior was added as an endogenous variable that was predicted by other variables in the model. Path E represents a link between perceivers’ responsive behavior during the interaction and perceivers’ subsequent memories of their behavior, which was significant in the model predicting T2 memories and marginal in the model predicting T3 memories. This path indicates that perceivers remembered some of their responsive behavior during the subsequent follow-up assessments that they did not recall immediately following the interaction (because this path was independent of perceivers’ perceptions of their behavior), suggesting some accuracy that emerged at the time of retrieval. Path F represents a link between perceivers’ immediate perceptions of their own responsive behavior following the interaction and perceivers’ memories of their responsive behavior during the follow-up assessments, which also was significant. This effect indicates stability (or storage) of perceivers’ perceptions over time; perceivers who initially encoded that they were responsive immediately after the interaction recalled being responsive during the follow-up assessments. Path G represents the effect of perceivers’ valuing of partners on their subsequent memories, which also was significant. This effect is central to the prediction that confirmation biases operate on memory, as it suggests that, independently of perceivers’ behavior and perceivers’ initial perceptions of their own behavior, perceivers who highly valued partners remembered their behavior as more responsive during the follow-up assessments. This effect suggests confirmation-biased memories that are independent of the confirmation-biased perceptions described earlier, suggesting a bias at the retrieval stage. This effect provides especially compelling evidence that perceivers’ representations of their own behavior are biased by their sentiments toward partners because, in this analysis, perceivers’ initial perceptions, which were already biased, were partialed from the effect.

          Figure 1 and extended the model to the domain of support interactions. Once again, perceivers’ who valued partners perceived that they enacted more responsive behavior toward their partners, and these judgments were partially accurate (based on actual enactment of responsive behavior) and partially biased (predicted by their sentiments toward partners). Perceivers who valued partners seemed to give themselves extra credit for having pro-relationship sentiments toward partners when they judged their own responsive behavior, producing an exaggeration of their responsive behavior and replicating results from Study 1. Once again, accurate and biased self-perception of responsive behavior had independent effects on perceivers’ security immediately following the interaction. Self-perceptions of responsive behavior also predicted security 2 weeks later. Hence, this study provided additional support for novel processes through which perceivers who value partners sustain relationship security. In addition, this study extended the model to memory. Independently of perceivers’ behavior and even their initial perceptions of their behavior (which were already positively biased), perceivers who valued partners remembered behaving in a more responsive manner 2 weeks and 6 months following the laboratory interaction. Six months following the interaction, perceivers’ memories of their responsive behavior predicted change in their relationship security.

Indeed, feeling secure in the partner’s reciprocation bolsters the perceiver’s psychological well-being and enhances the quality of relationships (
        Clark &amp; Lemay, 2010; 
        Murray et al., 2006; 
        Reis et al., 2004). Hence, individuals who value partners may have developed several strategies, conscious and unconscious, to sustain a sense of security that they are valued in return.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">What processes contribute to a sense that these valued partners reciprocate positive sentiments? Research and theorizing on security in interpersonal relationships tends to ignore the influence of perceivers’ own behavior in shaping the inferences perceivers make regarding how much they are valued by their partners. However, the current research illustrates the importance of perceivers’ representations of their own behavior in shaping these inferences. People tend to strongly believe that responsive behavior elicits positive sentiments from others, such as their satisfaction, commitment, and positive regard, whereas unresponsive behavior results in dissatisfaction, reduced commitment, devaluation, and ultimately rejection. The existence of such theories suggests that perceivers’ own behavior—or at least their cognitive representations of their own behavior—should be an important contributor to their perceptions of being valued by their partners. Accordingly, two studies revealed two novel mechanisms—accurate and biased self-perception—that seem to bolster relationship security for perceivers who strongly value their partners.</p><a id="psp-107-4-638-EEADA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Achieving Security Through Accurate Self-Perception</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Self-perception theory predicts that people learn about themselves by observing their own behavior and then making inferences about their qualities (
          Bem, 1972). An analogous process may occur in relationships in which people acquire knowledge about how their partner feels about them by observing their own behavior and then making inferences regarding how this behavior impacted the partner’s sentiments. When perceivers highly value partners, their more responsive behavior may create feelings of security. That is, Jack may behave in an especially kind or supportive manner toward Jill. After accurately reflecting on this behavior, Jack may believe he was especially kind or supportive, and this belief may lead him to assume that Jill is satisfied or thinks well of him. This may occur even if Jill did not actually have this response, as Jack may be overly focused on his own behavior and the consequences he expects. Both of the current studies provided support for this process. Perceivers who valued partners engaged in more responsive behavior in conflict and support interactions. Those who enacted responsive behavior, in turn, tended to perceive that they had done so following the interaction, suggesting some accuracy to perceivers’ perceptions of their own behavior. In turn, those who believed that they enacted responsive behaviors were more confident that they were valued by their partners following the interaction, and this was independent of partners’ reports of their sentiments toward perceivers. The indirect effect traversing each of these steps was significant, suggesting that accurate self-perception of responsive behavior was a significant explanation for why perceivers who valued partners felt secure following the interaction. Furthermore, Study 2 demonstrated a lagged effect; self-perceptions of responsive behavior following the interaction predicted improvements in relationship security 2 weeks later.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Study 2 extended the accurate self-perception process to memory and suggested two distinct routes to accurate memories. First, perceivers’ initial perceptions of their more responsive behavior was accurate, and these initial perceptions were stored for later recall. Second, perceivers remembered some aspects of their responsive behavior that they did not report immediately following the interaction. Both processes partially explained why perceivers who valued their partners remembered behaving in a more responsive manner during the follow-up sessions. In turn, memories of own responsive behavior predicted improvements in relationship security over time.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">This self-perception process underscores the importance of behavior and self-awareness for perceivers’ relationship security, as it suggests that perceivers’ responsive behavior bolsters security because perceivers are aware of their own responsive behavior, which creates beliefs regarding partners’ reactions. This process underscores that partners are not the only observers of perceivers’ behavior. Perceivers witness their own behavior, which has important implications for the inferences they draw regarding how their partners feel about them. This is an understudied source of interpersonal security. However, this view is consistent with arguments advanced by 
          Clark and Grote (1998), who proposed that behaving in a responsive manner may cause people to feel more confident that partners will care for them.
        </p><a id="psp-107-4-638-EDADA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Achieving Security Through Biased Self-Perception</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Confirmation biases—the operation of cognitive processes that produce conclusions that support existing beliefs—are pervasive (
          Nickerson, 1998) and were examined in the current research. The current research tested the prediction that perceivers exhibit a confirmation bias in their perceptions of their own responsive behavior, overestimating the degree to which their behavior toward partners is consistent with their existing sentiments toward partners. Moreover, perceivers who value partners may give themselves “extra credit” for these positive feelings when they evaluate their own behavior, credit that is not granted by outsiders, which would produce exaggeration of their responsive behavior relative to what outsiders see. Both studies supported these predictions. Perceivers saw their behavior as more consistent with their sentiments than did other people (partners or observers), and perceivers who valued partners were especially likely to exaggerate the responsiveness of their behavior relative to what other people perceived. Hence, perceivers’ self-perceptions of responsive behavior were derived from a blend of accuracy (the accurate self-perception process described above) and bias.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The process described above, in which perceivers infer partners’ sentiments on the basis of their perceptions of their own behavior toward partners, may occur even when perceivers have a biased and inaccurate understanding of their own behavior. Perceivers who highly value partners may be biased to perceive that their behavior was especially responsive, which could lead them to infer that their behavior elicited positive sentiments in their partners. Both of the current studies suggested the existence of this process. Perceivers who valued partners perceived that their behavior was responsive (independently of their actual behavior) and those who perceived that their behavior was responsive felt more secure that they were valued by partners following the interaction. The indirect effect linking these two paths was significant, suggesting that this process was a significant contributor to relationship security for perceivers who valued partners. In other words, as a result of his positive feelings toward Jill, Jack exaggerated the responsiveness of his own behavior, and these inflated self-assessments gave him confidence that Jill was happy with him. This process could happen often in light of (a) the difficulty of observing one’s own behavior; (b) the confirmation biases in judging own behavior described above; and (c) tendencies for people to consider how they (think they) behaved when inferring the partner’s sentiments, as described above. Indeed, this process was the strongest of the indirect processes investigated in this research. In addition, Study 2 demonstrated that this process predicts longitudinal changes in relationship security over 2 weeks.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Study 2 also extended the examination of bias to memory. Perceivers who valued partners had positively biased memories of their own responsive behavior, and this bias was due to two processes. In part, these memories were biased because the initial encoding of the information was biased, which was retained in memory. However, this study also indicated that perceivers’ memories of their behavior were biased above and beyond the bias that operated on their immediate perceptions. In other words, independently of whether perceivers had accurate immediate perceptions of their own behavior, their subsequent memories of that behavior were biased by their sentiments toward partners. This suggests that confirmation bias infiltrated both encoding and retrieval. In turn, as discussed above, memories of responsive behavior predicted improvements in relationship security over 6 months.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Like the accurate self-perception process described above, this process is entirely intrapersonal: Perceivers who value partners seem to bolster their own relationship security through processes that do not appear to depend on partners’ responses. Both processes underscore that perceivers make judgments about their own behavior and that these judgments can shape their security in the partner’s sentiments. However, accurate self-perception involves action combined with cognition (i.e., perceivers make inferences regarding how the partner feels about them based on their actual behavior toward the partner), whereas the biased self-perception process appears to unfold entirely in the head of perceivers (i.e., perceivers make inferences regarding how the partner feels about them based on their biased perceptions of their behavior toward the partner).</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">It is important to understand the distinction between accurate and biased self-perceptions of responsive behavior, because these processes suggest both avenues and potential roadblocks to the experience of being responsive to partners and feeling valued by partners. People may believe that they have been responsive to their partners because they actually were responsive and/or because they were biased into perceiving their behavior as consistent with their positive sentiments. When behavior and sentiments are both positive, accuracy and bias may converge to produce an especially compelling experience of having been responsive to partners. In turn, this may generate confidence that the partner is satisfied. In other cases, accuracy and bias may have opposing implications. For example, a person who does not have the ability or opportunity to enact responsive behavior toward a partner may nevertheless perceive that he or she was responsive as a result of having positive feelings toward partners. In this case, positive feelings toward partners may help people maintain positive relationship perceptions despite behavioral or situational realities that afford less positivity. In other words, bias can compensate for action. By the same token, as a result of accuracy, less responsive behavior should contribute to lower self-perceptions of responsiveness even for perceivers who value their partners. This may partially explain why even people who value their partners sometimes feel insecure about how much they are valued by their partners. In other cases, bias, rather than accuracy, may foster negative relationship perceptions. For instance, perceivers who do not value their partners may underestimate their own responsive behavior through the consistency bias examined in the current research. In turn, this could lead them to infer that they are devalued by their partners.</p><a id="psp-107-4-638-ECADA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Relation to Other Theoretical Models</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">It is important to note that, like every model, the model tested in the current research is situated within a more complex and unexamined network of causal processes. For example, several factors may determine whether people care for their partners, which were not examined in the current research. Risk regulation theory (see 
          Murray et al., 2006) and other interdependence perspectives (
          Wieselquist et al., 1999) predict that trust determines whether people are willing to depend on their partners and psychologically invest in relationships. Hence, trust may determine how much perceivers value their partners. The current research suggests that, in turn, how much people value their partners can shape their trust in their partners through both accurate and biased self-perception of behavior. Taken together, these findings may suggest cyclical processes: Trust may shape valuing of partners, which may bias subsequent trust-related perceptions. Such dynamics may contribute to the stability of trust and partner valuing over time (see also 
          Lemay &amp; Clark, 2008).
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The current model may relate to risk regulation and interdependence perspectives in another way. The current work suggests that people feel more secure in their partners’ satisfaction and commitment when they enact (or believe they enact) responsive behaviors toward their partners. This process likely depends on the existence of naive theories positing that responsive behavior elicits positive sentiments from others, whereas unresponsive behavior elicits negative sentiments. These naive theories likely exist because, as predicted by interdependence and risk regulation perspectives, others actually do respond to responsive behavior with pro-relationship sentiments and unresponsive behavior with negative sentiments. Thus, the operation of risk-regulation dynamics in which people approach responsive partners and distance themselves from unresponsive partners likely gives rise to belief structures that cause people to feel more secure when they enact responsive, relative to unresponsive, behaviors.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The current research also coheres with other research on biases in trust-related perceptions. People who strongly value relationships with their partners tend to see their partners as caring for them in return (
          Lemay et al., 2007), have positively biased memories of the partner’s behavior (
          Lemay &amp; Neal, 2013), and interpret situations in biased ways that preserve trust in the partner’s care (
          Lemay &amp; Melville, 2014). The current research adds to this literature by suggesting that people who value partners may think they behave in more responsive ways toward those partners, through both accuracy and bias, and these representations of their own behavior serve as an independent source of security in relationships.
        </p><a id="psp-107-4-638-EBADA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Strengths, Limitations, and Future Directions</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Several methodological strengths lend credibility to the conclusions described above. The primary findings were replicated across two behavioral observation studies, suggesting that the processes examined in the current research are robust and relevant to both conflict and support interactions. Moreover, both of the studies incorporated multiple accuracy benchmarks to assess perceivers’ behavior, including judgments made by their romantic partners and by objective observers. The team of objective observers was large (10 to 11 observers), and each observer rated all of the videos. These methods were highly rigorous and more rigorous than most research on accuracy and bias in self-perception.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In addition, the primary findings were subjected to extensive testing to address alternative explanations and limitations. The findings were not dependent on the particular accuracy benchmark that was used, and they were consistent across various indicators of perceivers’ valuing of partners (i.e., care, commitment, satisfaction, positive regard) and across various indicators of perceivers’ perceptions of the partner’s sentiments (i.e., perceived satisfaction, perceived regard, perceived commitment, perceived acceptance). The findings were not explained by trait self-esteem, which is often examined as a predictor of self-enhancement biases. The findings were independent of perceivers’ chronic relationship security, partners’ actual sentiments, and partners’ behavior. Furthermore, assuming that social desirability biases pervade reports of trait self-esteem and chronic security, social desirability biases do not seem to account for the current findings, given that the effects were still observed when controlling for these other variables. Alternative models that switched mediator and outcome variables were not supported.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The memory findings from Study 2 provide an extended replication of the primary findings and lend validity to a confirmation bias interpretation. A critic might argue that perceivers are in the best position to judge the responsiveness of their own behavior, perhaps because they attend to their behavior more than observers or partners do (an argument that would contradict research on perspective differences in social interaction; see 
          Andersen et al., 1998). Hence, a critic might reject the current arguments regarding perceivers’ inaccuracy and bias. The findings regarding memory address these criticisms by demonstrating that perceivers’ memories of their responsive behavior deviate from their immediate self-perceptions of behavior and their actual behavior, and in the direction of their sentiments toward perceivers. This inconsistency within perceivers across time suggests that perceivers are not unbiased judges of their own behavior.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">This research raises a number of important issues that could provide the basis for future investigations. Each of the processes described above likely depend on person, situation, and relationship factors, and a limitation of the current research is that these factors were not examined. For example, although the findings were not explained by partners’ behavior in the current research, more nuanced consideration of partners’ behavior may reveal moderation effects. For instance, partners may provide feedback that alters perceivers’ judgments of their own behavior, which could alter self-perception processes. Partners’ expressions of gratitude, for instance, may amplify perceivers’ judgments that they behaved in a responsive manner, which could then help them feel more secure that they are valued by partners. The processes also may increase or decrease in strength as a function of perceivers’ focus of attention. When perceivers are inordinately focused on their own behavior rather than partners’ reactions, self-perception processes may dominate.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">As described in the introduction, perspective differences in social interaction may provide leeway for perceivers to have biased perceptions of their own behavior. People are more aware and have clearer representations of their own subjective experiences relative to their own behaviors, whereas the opposite is true with regard to knowledge of other people. Perhaps person or situational factors that increase the accessibility or quality of information regarding own behavior would be accompanied by reductions in confirmation bias. Moreover, perhaps some aspects of responsiveness are less prone to bias because they are inherently subjective and, therefore, more accessible to perceivers. For example, paying attention to partners’ needs and having unconditional positive regard for partners may be components of responsiveness. These components are subjective, and so perceivers may have a more accurate understanding of these aspects of responsiveness relative to more behavioral facets.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Future research should examine specific mediators of the confirmation bias examined in the current research. Relative to judging others, when judging their own qualities, people are more likely to consider their intentions (
          Koehler &amp; Poon, 2006; 
          Kruger &amp; Gilovich, 2004), future potential (
          Williams, Gilovich, &amp; Dunning, 2012), and aspirations (
          Helzer &amp; Dunning, 2012), and these biases contribute to self-enhancing perceptions. For example, people see themselves as kind if they intended to be kind (
          Kruger &amp; Gilovich, 2004). Perhaps perceivers who have positive sentiments toward partners often intend and aspire to behave in responsive ways toward partners, and perhaps these intentions and aspirations then spill over and contaminate judgments of their own behavior. That is, perceivers who value partners may intend and hope to be a responsive partner and, therefore, they see their behavior in a more responsive light. Moreover, motivational mechanisms should be examined, such as the motivation to maintain existing perceptions of the self as caring for a particular partner. Finally, the current findings are correlational. Experimental manipulations of model variables would provide more compelling support for causal effects.

Perceivers who value partners may accurately reflect on their responsive behavior and assume that it elicited positive responses in partners (accurate self-perception). These perceivers also may have biased perceptions of their own responsive behavior as a result of their positive sentiments toward partners (confirmation bias), and these exaggerated perceptions of responsiveness may bolster confidence that they are valued by partners (biased self-perception). These findings underscore that we both witness and distort our own interpersonal behavior, and these processes are important for understanding whether we feel valued by our partners.</p><a id="psp-107-4-638-R" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_155" title="Footnotes">Footnotes</a></span><a id="fn1" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><sup>1</sup> The additional measures included measures of self-control, need to belong, attachment insecurity, individual differences in interpersonal value and desire to be valued, relationship-specific attachment insecurity, implicit theories of relationships, compassionate and self-image goals, perceptions of the partner’s insecurity, and tendencies to monitor the partner’s sentiments.
