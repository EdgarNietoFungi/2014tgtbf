How does attachment anxiety affect an initial interaction with a potential relationship partner? The present investigation explored the interpersonal outcomes associated with attachment anxiety in the context of various relational opportunities, testing a mediational model whereby interpersonal displays characteristic of state social anxiety—social disengagement and manifest anxiety—were proposed as mechanisms of interpersonal failure. In Study 1, participants engaged in speed-dating. In Study 2, participants were videotaped introducing themselves to an attractive, single, preferred-sex confederate who would ostensibly be deciding whether to meet them. In Study 3, participants were videotaped having a semistructured 40-min interaction with an attractive, friendly, single, preferred-sex confederate. Across all 3 contexts, attachment anxiety was associated with negative interpersonal outcomes, mediated by displays of social disengagement (Study 2) and manifest anxiety (Studies 1 and 3). The negative displays and outcomes associated with attachment anxiety were expressed behaviorally as verbal disfluencies and interpersonal awkwardness (Study 3). Overall, attachment anxiety was a robust predictor of interpersonal failure when presented with a relational opportunity. Such failures will reinforce the negative expectations underpinning state social anxiety, making it harder for more anxiously attached individuals to initiate and develop the satisfying relationships that might over time help them overcome their relational insecurity.

          <i>Pride and Prejudice</i></blockquote></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">With apologies to Austen, this truth about desiring a mate is nearly universally acknowledged for men and for women, regardless of their fortune (cf. 
        DePaulo &amp; Morris, 2005). Humans have a fundamental need for social connectedness; in adulthood our close friendships and especially our romantic relationships are key resources in satisfying this need (
        Baumeister &amp; Leary, 1995). These relationships are founded on some initial interaction between two potential relationship partners—a relational opportunity. Successfully navigating a relational opportunity is the first hurdle we must overcome to initiate the challenging process of relationship formation.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In the present research we sought to apply attachment theory (
        Bowlby, 1969/1982)—one of the most popular theories for investigating the subsequent stages of relationship development and maintenance—to the context of initial interactions and relationship initiation. Specifically, we were interested in whether individual differences in chronic attachment security and insecurity would affect people’s behavior in initial interactions and whether patterns of behavior characteristic of insecurity would compromise the possibility for relationship initiation. As detailed below, we hypothesized that the anxious form of attachment insecurity would be particularly problematic when navigating a relational opportunity. By integrating attachment theory with the self-presentational theory of social anxiety (
        Leary, 2010; 
        Schlenker &amp; Leary 1982), we developed a meditational model whereby attachment anxiety compromises relational opportunities via characteristic behavioral displays during these interactions.

        Bowlby, 1969/1982) proposes that we develop mental models of the self and others in relationships based on early experience with primary caregivers, and that these mental models guide our behavior, cognitions, and motivations throughout the lifespan (
        Ainsworth, Blehar, Waters, &amp; Wall, 1978; 
        Hazan &amp; Shaver, 1987, 
        1994; 
        Mikulincer &amp; Shaver 2003, 
        2007a). Depending on the reliability and availability of our significant others as sources of support, we develop individual differences in the functioning of these mental models: If these others are responsive to our needs, and are a reliable source of support that we can turn to in times of distress, we develop a sense of attachment security. If others are unresponsive or unreliable, we develop a sense of attachment insecurity. Depending on the particular relational contexts we encounter, this insecurity can take on two forms: If others are consistently unsupportive, we develop attachment avoidance, conceptualized as a discomfort with closeness and dependence (
        Brennan, Clark, &amp; Shaver, 1998). People who are high in attachment avoidance disdain others as a source of security and are instead compulsively self-reliant (
        Fraley &amp; Shaver, 1997; 
        Mikulincer, Dolev, &amp; Shaver, 2004). By contrast, if others are inconsistent sources of support, we develop attachment anxiety, which is conceptualized as a fear of abandonment and rejection (
        Brennan et al., 1998). Individuals who are high in attachment anxiety rely on others for security, seeking dependence and merging; they are preoccupied with their relationships due to their chronic fears that the other will leave them. Despite their strong motivation to bond with others, they tend to experience relationship dissatisfaction and dissolution (
        Collins &amp; Read, 1990; 
        Hazan &amp; Shaver, 1987; 
        Mikulincer &amp; Shaver, 2007a).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Although originally formulated typologically in the developmental literature, current work in adult attachment conceptualizes individual differences in attachment as existing in a continuous plane described by the two dimensions of avoidance and anxiety (
        Brennan et al., 1998; 
        Fraley, Waller, &amp; Brennan, 2000). The present investigation follows this conceptualization. An enormous body of literature has detailed the various ways in which attachment security and insecurity affect ongoing adult relationships (for a review, see 
        Mikulincer &amp; Shaver, 2007a). This includes many studies that have sustained the tradition of observing actual interpersonal behavior that was established in early attachment research (e.g., 
        Campbell, Simpson, Boldry, &amp; Kashy, 2005; 
        Collins &amp; Feeney, 2000). However, much less is known about how the attachment system operates during relational opportunities (
        Creasey &amp; Jarvis, 2008; 
        Finkel &amp; Eastwick, in press; 
        Mikulincer &amp; Shaver, 2007a). In the following sections we develop our theoretical framework for studying how individual differences in attachment affect behavior and outcomes in relationship initiation contexts.
      </p><a id="psp-106-1-89-ECFDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Attachment Theory in the Relationship Initiation Context</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Previous attachment research has focused on relationships with specific partners with whom one has a rich history of important relational experiences, called attachment figures (
          Hazan &amp; Shaver, 1994; 
          Mikulincer &amp; Shaver, 2007a). An interaction with a potential partner, with whom one may or may not someday form and develop a relationship, is obviously different from an interaction with an attachment figure, but there are two important reasons why we would still expect the attachment system to be activated and potentially influence behavior. First, 
          Bowlby (1969/1982) highlighted that one of the particular utilities of our attachment mental models was that they could be generalized; that is, when faced with novel relational situations, they provide top-down heuristics to guide our behavior and help us achieve the goal of felt security (see also 
          Brumbaugh &amp; Fraley, 2006; 
          Collins &amp; Read, 1994; 
          Thompson, 1999). Indeed, as 
          Mikulincer and Shaver (2007a, p. 286) suggest, in an initial interaction with a potential partner, about whom we have so little information and no pattern of previous interaction upon which to draw, we are likely to “detect the purest effects of chronic working models on relational behavior.” Second, theory clearly states that the attachment system is activated by the perception of either physical or psychological threat to the self (
          Bowlby, 1969/1982; 
          Mikulincer, Birnbaum, Woddis, &amp; Nachmias, 2000; 
          Mikulincer &amp; Shaver, 2003). Inherent to the context of relationship initiation are the threats of social evaluation and of potential rejection, which are among the most fundamental psychological threats to the self (
          MacDonald &amp; Leary, 2005). Thus, we propose two reasons why the attachment system influences behavior in relationship initiation contexts: The generalizability of attachment models to novel situations and the threat-triggered activation of the attachment system.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Given that there are differences in how the two forms of attachment insecurity affect attachment system activation, it becomes apparent that the anxious form of insecurity is especially likely to be problematic when meeting a potential partner whereas the avoidant form of insecurity may be less of an issue. High attachment avoidance is associated with chronic deactivation of the attachment system (
          Cassidy &amp; Kobak, 1988; 
          Mikulincer &amp; Shaver, 2003); consequently, people high in attachment avoidance may be unlikely to refer to their attachment mental models to guide behavior unless attachment system activation is strongly indicated. Moreover, the characteristic response to threat for people high in attachment avoidance is to down-regulate, devalue the threat and deactivate the system (
          Cassidy &amp; Kobak, 1988; 
          Mikulincer &amp; Shaver, 2003). Therefore, even in the face of a threat that triggers initial activation (e.g., the possibility of rejection), activation may not persist long enough to engender characteristic patterns of behavior for people high in avoidance. By contrast, high attachment anxiety is associated with chronic hyperactivation of the attachment system (
          Cassidy &amp; Kobak, 1988; 
          Mikulincer &amp; Shaver, 2003) as well as with hypervigilance for and heightened sensitivity to the threat of rejection (
          Downey &amp; Feldman, 1996; 
          Murray, Holmes, &amp; Collins, 2006)—an up-regulation instead of the down-regulation associated with avoidance. Therefore, when individuals higher in attachment anxiety are faced with a relational opportunity, because of chronic hyperactivation and hypervigilance to threat, attachment system activation is not only likely but may be potentially intrusive and problematic.
        </p><a id="psp-106-1-89-EBFDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Attachment Anxiety, the Motivation–Expectation Mismatch, and Social Anxiety</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">One of the key issues that might arise from this intrusive activation of more anxiously attached individuals’ sensitive and vigilant attachment systems is a mismatch between motivation and expectation that would make relational opportunities especially distressing. On one hand, people higher in attachment anxiety are desperately motivated to form strong interpersonal connections, and have heightened desires for closeness and even merging with others (
          Brennan et al., 1998; 
          Mikulincer &amp; Shaver, 2003). On the other hand, they are unlikely to believe that their efforts to connect will succeed, instead expecting rejection (
          Downey &amp; Feldman, 1996).
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">This mismatch between the motivation to connect and the expectation of being rejected are precisely the conditions identified by Leary and colleagues as leading to the experience of social anxiety (
          Leary, 2010; 
          Schlenker &amp; Leary 1982). Social anxiety arises when we are motivated to present ourselves in a desired way (e.g., as an appealing prospective relationship partner) but we doubt our potential to do so, anticipating that we will be rejected or otherwise devalued. Anyone might feel socially anxious in an initial interaction with a desired potential relationship partner—everyone wants to be accepted, and only the most confident among us would be completely assured of his or her own appeal. However, people high in attachment anxiety are likely to be especially susceptible to social anxiety because relationship initiation contexts potentiate a chronic ambivalence between their hopes of acceptance and fears of rejection (
          McClure, Bartz, &amp; Lydon, 2013; 
          Mikulincer, Shaver, Bar-On, &amp; Ein-Dor, 2010). As will become clear in the following section, it is useful to unpack the intrapsychic states (cognitions, motivations, and affective states) that may arise in this context and that may be exacerbated by attachment anxiety before we proceed to the interpersonal displays that will be the mechanisms of success or failure (cf. 
          Shaver &amp; Mikulincer’s, 2011, model of attachment and interpersonal behavior).
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Drawing the connection between attachment anxiety and social anxiety may seem intuitive or nearly tautological. Indeed, we are not the first to do so: For example, 
          Vertue (2003) proposed a detailed integration of various theories of social anxiety and social phobia under a broader attachment theory framework. Nonetheless, we are not aware of any work that has examined how these intrapsychic constructs (i.e., the trait-like mental models associated with attachment anxiety and the state of social anxiety) influence actual interpersonal behavior and therefore lead to negative interpersonal outcomes in relational opportunity contexts. This may be because, as Vertue noted, “traditionally, social anxiety has been investigated in nonintimate relationships, and attachment theory has been applied primarily to intimate relationships” (
          Vertue, 2003, p. 177). The context of relationship initiation, which begins with an initial interaction between two potential intimates, seems like an ideal context for further exploration.
        </p><a id="psp-106-1-89-EAFDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Interpersonal Displays as Mechanisms of Failure</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The present research joins the recent movement to advance social and personality psychology as a study of observable, meaningful behavior (
          Baumeister, Vohs, &amp; Funder, 2007; 
          Furr, 2009). In the context of an initial interaction, any intrapsychic state can only affect interpersonal outcomes to the extent that it is made manifest in some behavioral display, be it obvious and lasting or subtle and fleeting—our potential partners are not mind-readers. Previous work in the context of speed-dating has suggested that people higher in attachment anxiety are found unappealing by potential partners after an initial interaction (
          Luo &amp; Zhang, 2009; 
          McClure, Lydon, Baldwin, &amp; Baccus, 2010), but the mechanisms by which attachment anxiety is having its effect are still unknown. What interpersonal behaviors are people high in attachment anxiety displaying to their potential partners to compromise the relational opportunity?
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We expect, given the characteristic motivations and cognitions associated with attachment anxiety, and especially the mismatch between their hopes for acceptance and fears of rejection, that people higher in attachment anxiety will have problematic interpersonal displays consistent with a state of social anxiety. More specifically, we expect them to have displays of social disengagement and of manifest anxiety (
          Schlenker &amp; Leary, 1982). In the social anxiety literature, social disengagement arises in an effort to avoid or minimize the aversive social situation, and to distance the self from expected negative outcomes (
          Leary, 2010; 
          Schlenker &amp; Leary, 1982). Interestingly, this would be inconsistent with the predictions that one might make based on attachment theory alone, wherein the hyperactivation strategies associated with attachment anxiety would intensify proximity seeking and attempts to connect. Previous research examining how attachment anxiety and similar forms of insecurity affect social engagement or disengagement in initial interactions and relationship initiation contexts is mixed. Overall, findings are more consistent with disengaged and disaffiliative behaviors (e.g., reticence in making contact to set up a date, 
          Eastwick &amp; Finkel, 2008a; low warmth and sociability, 
          Stinson, Cameron, Wood, Gaucher, &amp; Holmes, 2009; inhibition, 
          Vorauer, Cameron, Holmes, &amp; Pearce, 2003) than with engagement (although see 
          Brumbaugh &amp; Fraley, 2010). Moreover, some findings that seem initially consistent with engagement (i.e., heightened self-disclosure, 
          Mikulincer &amp; Nachshon, 1991) reflected a preoccupation with the self and insensitivity to and disengagement from the interaction partner. Displays of social disengagement would not be well received by potential partners because it works against the reciprocity of liking effect (
          Beckman &amp; Secord, 1959; 
          Miller, 2012) and potential partners do not correct for others’ feelings of insecurity when judging their inhibition (
          Vorauer et al. 2003).
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We also predict that more anxiously attached people will overtly manifest their internal state of social anxiety (
          Schlenker &amp; Leary, 1982). That is, there will be leakage of the internal affective state arising from the motivation–expectancy mismatch. Previous research has linked attachment anxiety to preoccupation, nervousness, and rumination in the face of a relational opportunity, as measured by self-report and cognitive interference (
          Bartz &amp; Lydon, 2006) and by observer ratings (
          Brumbaugh &amp; Fraley, 2010). We are not aware of any research linking manifestations of anxiety to negative relationship initiation outcomes per se, but positive affect and attitudes are foundational to interpersonal attraction (
          Huston &amp; Levinger, 1978; 
          Miller, 2012). Processes such as mood contagion (e.g., 
          Neumann &amp; Strack, 2000) or the overgeneralizing of traits from emotions (e.g., 
          Montepare &amp; Dobish, 2003) would mean that a potential partner perceiving manifest anxiety would neither feel good nor form a positive impression. In the context of their existing relationships, more anxiously attached people might use manifestations of anxiety as suboptimal but successful strategies to engage the attention and care of an inconsistently responsive attachment figure. However, attachment and other theories of relationship development (
          Altman &amp; Taylor, 1983; 
          Holmes &amp; Rempel, 1989) predict that the display of manifest anxiety is inappropriate and maladaptive in the context of an initial interaction, and should be down-regulated.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We think that it is important to consider each of these two different displays of social anxiety to better understand the particular interpersonal problems that more anxiously attached people are experiencing. As we have described, although they arise from the same intrapsychic state of social anxiety, the interpersonal processes that link the displays to failure are likely to be different (e.g., “She didn’t seem to want to talk to me; I don’t like her.” versus “She seemed really anxious; that was unappealing.”). Moreover, other situational and dispositional factors may exacerbate or attenuate one display or the other. For example, interacting with a particularly friendly, sociable partner may overcome disengagement, or interacting with a very warm, accepting partner could mitigate anxiety. It is also possible that the hyperactivated connection motive associated with attachment anxiety could enable more anxiously attached people to overcome the impulse to disengage, even though their underlying insecurities might still be overtly displayed (similar to what was found by 
          Brumbaugh &amp; Fraley, 2010). Gaining a better understanding of the varied ways in which the internal state of social anxiety might be externally manifested across different relational opportunities is key to understanding the negative interpersonal consequences that follow.
        </p><a id="psp-106-1-89-EEDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_24" title="The Present Research">The Present Research</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We conducted the present research to systematically explore how individual differences in attachment security and insecurity—particularly anxious insecurity—affect behavior and outcomes during the earliest stages of relationship initiation. We proposed and tested a meditational model, illustrated in 
        Figure 1. We expected that more anxiously attached people would experience interpersonal failure when presented with a relational opportunity (the 
        <em>c</em> path), and that they would be especially prone to problematic interpersonal displays characteristic of a state of social anxiety (the 
        <em>a</em> path), and that these interpersonal displays would contribute to their negative outcomes (the indirect effect, 
        <em>ab</em>). Because relational opportunities might be found in any number of situations (e.g., a bar or party, online, at work or school, etc.), we tested the model in a variety of initial interactions: Engaging in speed-dating (Study 1), introducing oneself to an attractive, available member of the preferred sex who is deciding whether or not to interact with you (Study 2), and interacting with a friendly, attractive, available member of the preferred sex while working on a collaborative laboratory task (Study 3). These three highly impactful contexts allowed us to examine interpersonal outcomes and interpersonal behavior directly without having to rely on retrospective or hypothetical self-reports. Moreover, by using these three very different initial interaction paradigms, we were able to look for converging evidence for our model across contexts. Although we expect to see similar patterns of results across the three contexts, it is nonetheless possible that differences will emerge. We will be open to cautiously discussing these contextual differences, especially as they may suggest future directions for ameliorating the behavior or outcomes of more insecure people.

Previous research has shown null and negative effects for attachment avoidance on speed-dating outcomes (
        Luo &amp; Zhang, 2009; 
        McClure et al., 2010) and mixed effects on interpersonal displays in a relational opportunity context (
        Brumbaugh &amp; Fraley, 2010). Whether attachment avoidance will affect outcomes in the relational opportunity context, and if so, through what sorts of displays and behaviors, are open questions that we can begin to explore in these studies.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Finally, in Study 3 we sought to complement the more holistic, impressionistic interpersonal displays with a more granular examination of interpersonal behavior with intensive exploratory coding. More specific identification of the behaviors associated with unappealing interpersonal displays would be an initial step toward finding bottom-up avenues for intervention to improve negative relationship initiation outcomes.</p><a id="psp-106-1-89-EDDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_29" title="Study 1: Speed-Dating">Study 1: Speed-Dating</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In the first study, we examined attachment anxiety and relationship initiation using a real-world paradigm: speed-dating. Speed-dating is an event attended by single people who rotate through brief interactions—typically 5 min or less—with each of the other participants (in our studies) of the other sex. At the end of the event, participants indicate to the organizers whether they are interested in pursuing further contact with any of the people they met; if both participants are interested, they have made a “match” and receive each other’s contact information. Speed-dating is an excellent source of data, as it involves numerous systematic dyadic interactions with actual relational consequences (
        Eastwick &amp; Finkel, 2008b).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We supplemented the basic speed-dating procedure with additional measurements throughout the event that allowed us to look at participants’ interpersonal displays in the speed-dating context, and to relate the displays to actual interpersonal outcomes. We hypothesized that individuals higher in attachment anxiety would have undesirable interpersonal displays, which would lead to more rejection by their speed-dating partners.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Given that physical attractiveness is a powerful filter for initial interpersonal attraction, we wanted to control for “objective” physical attractiveness as a predictor of speed-dating success. However, we also explored the provocative possibility that attachment anxiety might compromise perceptions of attractiveness, even within a 3-min speed date. Although previous research (
        McClure et al., 2010; 
        Tidwell, Reis, &amp; Shaver, 1996) has not shown an association between physical attractiveness and attachment, these ratings were made by research assistants, for whom the targets’ attractiveness had no interpersonal implications. Ratings of attractiveness made by speed-dating partners seem different: If more anxiously attached participants are less popular at speed-dating, we might expect this to be reflected in partner’s perceptions of their attractiveness, above and beyond what is perceived by objective raters. We also hypothesize that such biases in speed-dating partners’ attractiveness ratings would be due to the unappealing interpersonal displays emitted by more anxiously attached participants during their speed dates.

This survey included the 36-item Experiences in Close Relationships scale (ECR; 
            Brennan et al., 1998), which consisted of an 18-item subscale for attachment anxiety (α = .92) and an 18-item subscale for attachment avoidance (α = .93). The speed-dating event proceeded as follows: As participants arrived and signed in for speed-dating, a group of four (Sample 1) or five (Sample 2) research assistants (RAs) made unobtrusive ratings of participants’ attractiveness from 1 to 10 (higher numbers indicate higher attractiveness).

The ratings were made on a 7-point Likert scale, on several dimensions, with the first descriptor at 1 and the second at 7. Participants rated face valid items representing the hypothesized interpersonal displays of social disengagement (

Males then rotated to the next table; females remained seated. Halfway through the event there was a 15-min break. At the end of the event, participants returned their booklets; we tabulated the matches made and e-mailed participants with their matches’ contact information.</p><a id="psp-106-1-89-EBDDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Results</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Structure of the data set</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The speed-dating paradigm generates complex multilevel data, which can be conceptualized using an actor-partner interaction framework (
            Kenny, Kashy, &amp; Cook, 2006): The focal participant, or actor, is the upper level unit, and their speed-dates with each of their potential partners are the lower level units. The data set is constructed such that each actor has a separate row of data for each speed-date (between 16 and 23 rows per participant). Another way to think of this is that a given speed-date, for example, between Tommy and Gina, is represented on two rows of data: One row where Tommy is the actor and Gina the partner, with Tommy’s Level 2 data (e.g., his attractiveness, his attachment anxiety) and Gina’s ratings of him at Level 1, and one where Gina is the actor and Tommy is the partner, with Gina’s Level 2 data and Tommy’s ratings of her at Level 1.

            Table 1). Actors higher in attachment anxiety were seen on average as more manifestly anxious but not more socially disengaged. Attachment anxiety and both displays were associated with less favorable speed-dating outcomes on average. Although the association between attachment anxiety and RA-rated attractiveness was not significant, consistent with previous work (
            McClure et al., 2010; 
            Tidwell et al., 1996), and partner-rated attractiveness was highly correlated with RA-rated attractiveness, higher attachment anxiety was associated with lower partner-rated attractiveness.

Also, more anxiously attached individuals were rated as less attractive by their partners; this effect is above-and-beyond their attractiveness as rated by research assistant observers.

We examined the mediation using a regression model with both attachment anxiety and the manifest anxiety display predicting the speed-dating outcome, covarying for gender, attachment avoidance, research-assistant-rated attractiveness, and sample (all grand-mean centered). The effect of attachment anxiety on the speed-dating outcomes was not moderated by gender, but there was evidence of anxiety by gender interactions predicting the display of manifest anxiety. In any case, we did not have sufficient power to effectively test moderated multilevel mediation. Accordingly, we calculated the effect estimates for the mediation models without the gender by anxiety interaction, still covarying for gender, attachment avoidance, research-assistant-rated attractiveness, and sample. We followed up with exploratory analyses for the mediation via manifest anxiety split by gender. Although this splitting does not test moderation by gender directly, and moreover decreases our power to detect the unmoderated indirect effects, we thought it would be informative nonetheless.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">As recommended by 
            Zhang et al. (2009, which is an update of

Moreover, higher levels of attachment anxiety predicted lower attractiveness ratings from potential partners, above-and-beyond assessments of attractiveness made by research assistant observers. We also found partial support for our hypotheses that attachment anxiety would be associated with characteristic interpersonal displays of social disengagement and of manifest anxiety, and that these displays would carry the effect of attachment anxiety to the outcomes: More anxiously attached participants were seen as more manifestly anxious but this was moderated by gender such that the effect of attachment anxiety was stronger and more reliable for males being rated by females than for females being rated by males. Nonetheless, we found marginal mediation via the display of manifest anxiety for both outcomes and significant mediation whereby more anxiously attached men were failing at speed-dating because they appeared more manifestly anxious to their female partners.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Although our relatively small sample size makes us cautious in interpreting null findings conclusively, there are interesting speculative explanations. The null result for the social disengagement display may be attributable to contextual effects or to self-selection. That is, speed-dating is explicitly designed as an opportunity to connect with potential partners, and so the norms of the speed-dating context may dampen social disengagement or the people who attend speed-dating may be those who have overcome social disengagement. As to why we found that attachment anxiety reliably predicted the manifest anxiety display for males but not for females, we believe that the speed-dating context may be obscuring the signal of attachment anxiety for female actors. Although both genders must navigate the dual challenges of presenting themselves well and of evaluating the presentation of potential partners, in the context of speed-dating, men may be slightly more focused on the former and women on the latter. Men tend to be less selective at speed-dating (e.g., 
          McClure et al., 2010). Part of this may be attributable to an artifact of the traditional speed-dating paradigm (
          Finkel &amp; Eastwick, 2009): More selective norms and cognitions are activated by being in the role of the person being approached (i.e., the females who remain seated) as compared to the person doing the approaching (i.e., the males who rotate from partner to partner). This also could be attributed to different evolutionary pressures acting to make women relatively more selective than men (
          Buss &amp; Schmitt, 1993). As a result, male partners may be less attentive to the signal of anxiety in female actors than would be female partners in male actors, because the males may be more preoccupied with their own self-presentation while females would be more preoccupied with evaluating potential partners. It is important to note, though, that male partners did not appear to be completely inattentive to attachment anxiety—both males and females were less attracted to and less interested in pursuing further contact with more anxiously attached participants, and the interactions between attachment anxiety and gender were not significant for these outcomes. In sum, we found links between attachment anxiety and the speed-dating, and between attachment anxiety and the display of manifest anxiety; in the next studies looked to replicate these results and provide clearer findings for the mediation model as a whole.

Single, heterosexual participants filmed brief videos introducing themselves. To ensure the activation of the more anxiously attached participants’ chronic relational insecurities, participants were told that another attractive, single peer of the preferred sex would ostensibly be deciding whether to have a face-to-face interaction based on their introduction. This paradigm may appear lower in ecological validity relative to speed-dating, but we believed it to have a real-world analogue in online dating, wherein one develops a static profile of the self to present to prospective partners. This paradigm allowed us to maintain a high level of psychological impact while strictly controlling any potential interpersonal variability (i.e., partner and interaction effects) so as to maximize the influence of intrapersonal forces, such as attachment anxiety. We hypothesized that the participants high in attachment anxiety would again be disliked based on their introductions, and that this would be due to interpersonal displays of social disengagement and manifest anxiety.</p><a id="psp-106-1-89-ECCDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Ninety-two single, heterosexual participants (41 female), ages 18–26 years (

Their partner would be watching the video and then deciding whether they would like to have a face-to-face interaction with the participant. After asking if the participant understood how the study worked, the experimenter obtained the participant’s informed consent. The participant then received an initial questionnaire package, which concluded with the ECR measure of attachment (α = .91 for anxiety and α = .94 for avoidance).

First, we found that increased attachment anxiety was associated with lower interpersonal appeal. Second, more anxiously attached individuals showed both of the interpersonal displays that we had hypothesized based on our integration of attachment theory and the self-presentational model of social anxiety: Increased attachment anxiety was associated with displays of social disengagement and of manifest anxiety. This association between attachment anxiety and social disengagement, which we thought might have been obscured by the speed-dating context, is of particular note. Third, we again showed a link between displays of social disengagement and manifest anxiety and a negative interpersonal outcome. Finally, problematic interpersonal displays were a mechanism by which more anxiously attached participants were failing. Although in separate tests, each display mediated the link between attachment anxiety and interpersonal outcome (
          <em>p</em>s &lt; .05), the multiple meditational model revealed that social disengagement was stronger and sufficient in mediating the relationship between anxiety and decreased likeability. Unlike in Study 1, none of these effects were qualified by significant gender interactions. Moreover, these effects occurred in half a minute—an even shorter time frame than speed-dating.
        </p><a id="psp-106-1-89-EBDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_86" title="Study 3: Confederate Interaction">Study 3: Confederate Interaction</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We sought to combine the unique strengths of the first two studies into a new paradigm that incorporated both the real-time face-to-face dyadic interaction of Study 1 and the experimental control of Study 2. Accordingly, we engineered lab sessions wherein participants were presented with a relational opportunity in the form of a semistructured interaction with an attractive, friendly, ostensibly available member of the preferred sex. We employed trained confederates for the interactions, and research assistants reviewed videotapes to rate the outcomes and displays as in Study 2. Moreover, we conducted exploratory coding to identify potential behavioral mechanisms contributing to social failure.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">This new paradigm afforded us two major advantages over both speed-dating and the videotaped introductions. First, we were able to increase the length of the interaction compared to Studies 1 and 2. Increasing the length of the initial interaction provides us with a larger sample of participants’ relationship initiation behaviors, which will improve measurement (although people do form surprisingly accurate perceptions of others from “thin slices” of behavior; cf. 
        Ambady, Bernieri, &amp; Richeson, 2000). Having a larger sample of behavior may be especially helpful in distinguishing between the display of social disengagement and the display of manifest anxiety as it may allow observers to distinguish specific nuances that were not apparent in thinner slices of behavior. Moreover, in a longer initial interaction, especially one in which the potential partner is friendly, individuals high in attachment anxiety may have the opportunity to down-regulate their state of social anxiety, thereby gradually engaging with the partner and manifesting less anxiety.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Second, we were able to present participants with a partner who would not be concerned with their own relationship initiation outcomes—namely, a trained confederate. We were especially interested in presenting participants with a relatively less evaluative, less threatening interpersonal situation than in the previous studies, to see if more anxiously attached participants would manifest unappealing interpersonal displays even when circumstances were relatively favorable. Accordingly, our confederates were not merely attractive; they were also selected and trained to be warm and friendly. However, previous research by 
        Baldwin and Kay (2003) using a social cognitive paradigm found that the chronic rejection sensitivity (
        Downey &amp; Feldman, 1996; 
        Mikulincer &amp; Shaver, 2003) associated with attachment anxiety is resistant to priming with acceptance cues. Therefore, we expected that even in this longer, lower threat interaction, more anxiously attached participants would continue to have negative social outcomes and unappealing interpersonal displays, and we expected that these displays would mediate the relationship between attachment anxiety and failure.

The analyses were conducted on the remaining 86 participants (49 female), ages 18–27 years (
            <em>M</em> age = 19.3,

The interaction was filmed with their knowledge and consent. Confederates were hired based on their attractiveness and interpersonal skills and attended several training sessions. Although they did not have a detailed script for the interaction, the confederates were instructed to be interpersonally warm and told that their goal was for the participant to have a positive interaction with them. They were instructed to greet the participant in a warm manner at the beginning of the interaction. The confederates were instructed not to appear too assertive or too familiar with the study procedures and materials; their instructions included asking the experimenter a scripted question to clarify the procedure of the laboratory task and they were told to first ask the participant how he or she wanted to proceed then suggest sharing or turn-taking as appropriate.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">At the beginning of the session, the experimenter verbally collected demographic information, allowing participants to hear that the confederate was ostensibly single. After receiving the introduction to the study—that the researchers were investigating how people might together form an impression of a third party—the participant and confederate sat quietly and independently completed several questionnaires. These included a 29-item version of the ECR (modified from 
              Brennan et al., 1998, by N. L. Collins, personal communication, April 21, 2005), consisting of 14 items measuring attachment anxiety (α = .93) and 15 items measuring attachment avoidance (α = .88), each rated from 1 (
              <em>disagree strongly</em>) to 7 (
              <em>agree strongly</em>).
            </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Next, the confederate and the participant were asked to select three interview clips from a list of nine recordings of television interview programs. After this discussion, they provided their choices to the experimenter and began watching the interviews. After each clip, they discussed and came to a consensus about their impression of the interviewee on a provided form. To create a realistic, engaging, generally positive interaction, for the first and third clips the confederate was instructed to select ratings towards the mid-point of the scale, and move towards agreement with the participant and to engage in friendly disagreement and persuasion for the second clip.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Upon completion, they notified the experimenter, who explained that they would next be asked to provide their impressions of each other and that they would be taken to separate rooms to do so. The confederate was instructed to react in a natural but positive way, looking over at the participant and smiling nervously to acknowledge the awkwardness of the situation, but not reorienting away from the participant on the couch. The participant and confederate were left alone briefly before the confederate was led away. The participant completed their ratings of the confederate. When they finished, the experimenter turned the camera off and conducted a funneled probe for suspicion, then sensitively debriefed and compensated the participant.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><em>Ratings of impressions and interpersonal displays</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Three male and three female peer research assistants rated the interaction videos for each of the participants of the other sex. The interaction was rated in segments and as a whole; we focus on the earliest part of the interaction here, approximately 10 min in duration, up to the point when the participant and confederate had discussed and selected which celebrity interviews to watch.

                    <i>How much would you like to be friends with/date the participant?</i>) on a 9-point Likert scale, from 
                    <i>not at all</i> (1) to 
                    <i>very much</i> (9). ICCs for the average impression ranged from .65 to .70.
                  </li><li><i>Attractiveness.</i> Before watching any of the interaction, research assistants rated participants’ attractiveness at baseline using a freeze-frame from the beginning of the video. They made this rating on a double-anchored scale from 
                    <i>unattractive</i> (1) to 
                    <i>attractive</i> (10; ICC = .71 for female RAs and .77 for male RAs). They also rated attractiveness after watching the first minutes of the interaction, using a single item on a double-anchored scale from

                    <i>attractive</i> (7; ICC = .74 for female RAs and .81 for male RAs). We created a mean for each rating by averaging across RAs. The ratings were highly intercorrelated, 
                    <i>r</i>(84) = .88. At baseline, the attractiveness rating is uninformed by the interaction; this is analogous to the research-assistant-rated attractiveness in Study 1. By contrast, during the first minutes the attractiveness rating is potentially informed by the participant’s behavior; this rating is analogous to the partner-rated attractiveness in Study 1. Accordingly, for the analyses below these attractiveness rating from the first minutes is included in the interpersonal appeal outcome, while the baseline attractiveness rating is included as a covariate.

In essence, we hoped to replace the more holistic, impressionistic interpersonal display mediator with more granular coding of behavior. Although potential partners are more likely to be consciously processing interpersonal displays—presumably aggregating specific behaviors at some implicit level—it is the specific behaviors that are more likely to be targeted by interventions. In combination, these two complementary levels of analysis provide a more complete picture of how attachment anxiety is manifested in the context of a relational opportunity.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Given that manifest anxiety was consistently identified across all studies as a mechanism of failure at the level of the interpersonal displays, we focused on identifying the specific behaviors that give rise to this impression of anxiety. We singled out the 20 Study 3 videos that were rated either highest or lowest in manifest anxiety. Three new research assistants, who were blind to the previous ratings and to attachment, extensively reviewed the first 10-min segment of these videos. The research assistants independently generated both exhaustive descriptive notes and notes specifically focusing on the particular behaviors that might be indicative or counterindicative of anxiety. These notes were then condensed into a concrete list of behaviors. Using this list, one of the aforementioned research assistants then reviewed the notes again, this time explicitly comparing participants high and low in manifest anxiety so as to identify the behaviors that were especially diagnostic.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Based on these diagnostic behaviors as well as preliminary coding trials we developed and refined a final coding scheme with 16 items to be examined in two rounds: Vocal mechanisms (see 
            Appendix B) and full-modal mechanisms (see 
            Appendix C). Three new research assistants were recruited and trained on the coding scheme using the 15 videos that had been discarded due to suspicion. The research assistants then reviewed the 86 videos each in a different random order. The reliabilities are presented in

As expected, each of these behaviors was correlated with the display of manifest anxiety, but they were not correlated with the interpersonal appeal outcome. Given that these three behavioral codes were low in reliability, we sought to optimize our efforts by standardizing and combining them into a vocal disfluency composite (i.e., instances of unclear speech + awkward silences + reversed steadiness of voice).

Compared to the rapid-fire context of speed-dating and the explicitly evaluative context of the video-taped introductions, simply meeting a warm, friendly potential partner in a longer, more structured, and task-oriented interaction seems less likely to provoke social anxiety. However it was still problematic for more anxiously attached participants. Attachment anxiety again predicted negative interpersonal outcomes, whereby more anxiously attached participants were found unappealing, above and beyond their baseline physical attractiveness. Moreover, attachment anxiety predicted a display of manifest anxiety, which mediated the relationship between attachment anxiety and the negative interpersonal outcomes. This pattern of results was apparent within the first 10 min of the interaction and when considering the interaction as a whole. We no longer find the significant association between attachment anxiety and social disengagement—this is consistent with Study 1 but not with Study 2. If the effect of attachment anxiety on social disengagement is small, then we may not have had sufficient statistical power to find it. We will return to the pattern of results for social disengagement across the three studies in the General Discussion.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We also explored the potential behavioral mechanisms whereby attachment anxiety was leading to negative interpersonal outcomes using more fine-grained coding to complement the more holistic, impressionistic interpersonal displays. We found that attachment anxiety was associated with specific negative, off-putting behaviors, which could be grouped together as vocal disfluencies and interpersonal awkwardness. Although vocal disfluencies were a part of the display of manifest anxiety, it appeared that it was interpersonally awkward behavior that contributed directly to negative outcomes.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">This initial exploration was not without limitations. In particular, certain behaviors were difficult to code reliably. It is important, though, to acknowledge a particular strength, namely, that the set of research assistants doing the coding of the behaviors was completely different from the set of research assistants who coded the displays and outcomes. The coding of behavior is time consuming and labor and personnel intensive, but we think it is important and valuable data to collect, and hope that this exploration might offer some initial direction for future research.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Finally, unlike the previous two studies, we found significant effects of attachment avoidance. As with our other null findings, it is possible that the effects of avoidance are small and so we were generally underpowered to find them. Another intriguing possibility suggested by these findings is that in addition to adding more participants, future researchers interested in how avoidance affects relationship initiation might consider adding more time—the effects of avoidance may emerge over the course of a longer interaction. In contrast to anxious attachment models, which are chronically hyperactivated, it may take some time for avoidant attachment models to overcome chronic deactivation and to influence interpersonal behavior in initial interaction contexts.</p><a id="psp-106-1-89-EADA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_134" title="General Discussion">General Discussion</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In three different, high-impact relationship opportunity contexts, attachment anxiety was a reliable, robust predictor of interpersonal failure and this was apparent within the first minutes of an initial interaction. Specifically, we found that more anxiously attached individuals had fewer partners interested in pursuing contact with them at speed-dating and were rated as less attractive than their physical appearance would merit (Study 1); they were also found to be interpersonally unappealing (Studies 2 and 3). These effects were above and beyond objective physical appearance, which was itself not associated with anxiety (Studies 1 and 3). This is especially impressive given that appearance-based attractiveness is highly salient and is highly predictive of being pursued as a potential dating partner.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Attachment anxiety was associated with characteristic interpersonal displays of social disengagement and of manifest anxiety, which we proposed based on the integration of attachment theory and the self-presentational theory of social anxiety (
        Leary, 2010; 
        Schlenker &amp; Leary, 1982; 
        Vertue, 2003). These displays then acted as the mechanisms of relational failure. However, the particular display that was driving the effects varied across studies. We believe that these variations were not due to noise, but to meaningful effects of context—that is, individuals high in attachment anxiety behaved both in accordance with their internal states and with the demands of the situation (
        Arriaga, Agnew, Capezza, &amp; Lehmiller, 2008; 
        Kelley et al., 2003).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The display of manifest anxiety was associated with attachment anxiety across all three studies. It was also a consistent predictor of negative interpersonal outcomes across all three studies and mediated the relationship between attachment anxiety and the outcomes. It would appear that, at least across the three different contexts we looked at here, displays of manifest anxiety are consistently problematic for anxiously attached individuals. In an ironic self-fulfilling prophecy, manifest anxiety over anticipated rejection leads to rejection.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The social disengagement display, like the manifest anxiety display, was a consistent predictor of negative interpersonal outcomes, but the association between attachment anxiety and social disengagement was only found in Study 2. Although we cannot rule out that these between-study differences are due to chance variation, we nonetheless want to consider potential interpretations.
        <a id="b-fn18"> </a><sup /> One possibility is that although people high in attachment anxiety may be particularly likely to experience the motivation–expectation conflict that underlies social anxiety, their hyperactivated motivation to connect can overcome the tendency to disengage in certain contexts. Study 2 differed from Studies 1 and 3 in that it did not involve a live interaction with the potential partner—only a self-presentation to that partner via videotape and the prospect of an interaction if that self-presentation was deemed acceptable. In this situation, wherein the partner is desirable but distant and relatively abstract (cf. 
        Eastwick, Finkel, &amp; Eagly, 2011), and evaluation apprehension is high, more anxiously attached participants may adopt a disengagement strategy to preempt painful rejection. It is possible that the face-to-face presence of the potential partner engaging in the interaction is sufficient to overcome this social disengagement, which was not something afforded to Study 2 participants. This lack of a physically present potential partner is not the norm in relationship initiation, but it is part of the online dating paradigm. Although it may seem intuitive that the increasingly popular world of online dating would be helpful to more anxiously attached people, providing a lower pressure situation that would allow them to overcome their insecurities and would mitigate their state social anxiety, it may instead be ironically problematic. The lack of live interaction may lead anxious individuals to be more inhibited (similar to their reticence to send an e-mail overture in 
        Eastwick &amp; Finkel, 2008a). However, a physically present partner might not guarantee engagement. Consider, for example, being unexpectedly introduced to someone by a friend who is trying to encourage your romantic life: “Have you met Ted?” When presented with a live interaction with overt romantic potential (unlike Study 3) that they are unprepared for (unlike Study 1) more anxiously attached people might still freeze or pull away.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Across the three studies, the displays were moderately to highly correlated with each other. Indeed, we propose that they are two different external consequences of the same underlying internal state of social anxiety. It is important to consider that in the real world, potential partners may not be systematically processing particular independent displays, but instead perceive a gestalt impression. Moreover, potential partners may make rapid, binary, approach/avoid decisions, rather than locating their judgment along a dimension. It is nonetheless important to understand the component pieces that are leading to the negative impressions anxiously attached people are presenting.
        <a id="b-fn19"> </a><sup /> Even if the details might not matter to the potential partner, the details are important when it comes to creating interventions to improve relationship initiation outcomes, as discussed further below. Although one would have the longer term goal of alleviating the internal state of social anxiety, in the short-term one might focus on correcting problematic behaviors. However, an intervention that sought only to address social disengagement without addressing the display of manifest anxiety would not be successful—as we show in our studies, even when more anxiously attached people were not significantly more socially disengaged they were nonetheless failing because of their manifest anxiety.
      </p><a id="psp-106-1-89-EBADA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Strengths, Limitations, and Future Directions</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The present research is empirically strong, as all of our mediator and outcome measures were based on the observation of participants’ behavior. The use of retrospective or hypothetical self-reports is not uncommon in attachment research and the question of how attachment anxiety is associated with behaviors and outcomes could have been investigated using these methods. Instead, we elected to observe behavior and outcomes in initial interactions directly. Although this presented certain challenges (e.g., necessitating the additional step of coding video tapes, the logistic complexity of conducting research in the field) the reward is that conclusions drawn about behaviors and outcomes in the abstract are in fact based on the observation of behaviors and outcomes that actually occurred.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">By contrast, a limitation of the present research would be a near-Skinnerian lack of cognitive or affective data. Although we carefully apply attachment theory and the self-presentational theory of social anxiety to work through the intrapsychic precursors to our predicted interpersonal displays, all of the reported findings occur extrapsychically. Still, it is not one’s thoughts or feelings that are the proximal mechanism of failure in an initial interaction with a potential partner, it is the ways in which those thoughts and feelings are made manifest in one’s behavior for a potential partner to perceive. Future research should work to provide a better understanding of the particular intrapsychic states that are contributing to negative behaviors.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">One of the ways in which it would be helpful to have a more detailed understanding of the underlying cognitions and emotions is to differentiate between attachment anxiety and other constructs. The present research could suggest that attachment anxiety acts like a disposition rather than as a more relational construct (
          Pietromonaco &amp; Feldman Barrett, 2000). A more traditional dispositional variable that is associated with attachment anxiety would be neuroticism; they are consistently correlated around .40 (see 
          Mikulincer &amp; Shaver, 2007a, Chapter 13, for a review; see also 
          Noftle &amp; Shaver, 2006; 
          Shaver &amp; Brennan, 1992). In the first two studies we measured neuroticism, and although it was consistently correlated with attachment anxiety it was less consistently correlated with interpersonal outcomes and interpersonal displays. This is consistent with previous work which describes attachment anxiety and neuroticism as naturally and theoretically intertwined (
          Noftle &amp; Shaver, 2006; 
          Shaver &amp; Brennan, 1992). In contrast to neuroticism—which appears to have a biological foundation (
          Larsen &amp; Buss, 2010) and could predispose one to developing attachment anxiety—attachment anxiety is founded on experience, and as such can happen to anyone. Even chronically secure or avoidant people have relationships in which they experience high degrees of attachment anxiety and therefore have anxiety schemas available in memory (
          Baldwin, Keelan, Fehr, Enns, &amp; Koh-Rangarajoo, 1996). Certain situations (e.g., meeting a potential partner who calls to mind an ex-partner to whom one was anxiously attached; 
          Brumbaugh &amp; Fraley, 2006) could invoke the motivation–expectation mismatch characteristic of attachment anxiety and state social anxiety. In focusing on attachment anxiety and the principles of attachment theory more generally, as well as integrating work on the self-presentational model of social anxiety, this research is applicable beyond general individual differences.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Having demonstrated that attachment anxiety is detrimental to behavior and outcomes in initial interpersonal interactions, what possibilities exist to ameliorate these effects? From the attachment theory perspective, the type of intervention that is typically pursued is priming felt security. Most people, even the chronically anxiously attached, have had some relationships wherein they experienced felt security and so have secure schemas available even if they are not ordinarily activated (
          Baldwin et al., 1996). There is a large literature in which researchers have used various priming techniques to increase the accessibility of felt security (see 
          Mikulincer &amp; Shaver, 2007b, for a review). However, in the context of a relational opportunity the potential partner may be such a salient feature of the situation as to overwhelm any subtle priming effects. One way to maximize the effectiveness of a felt security prime would be to embed it in the situation using transference techniques (
          Berk &amp; Andersen, 2000). Making the potential partner seem similar to someone who acts as a secure attachment figure to a chronically anxious individual would both make the partner themselves the security prime, and would decrease the perceived risk of their rejection. This would be similar to work by 
          Stinson et al. (2009), wherein features of the interaction partner were manipulated to alleviate participants’ rejection concerns.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Considering the question of whether individuals high in attachment anxiety would benefit from cognitive, upstream interventions or would require more situationally embedded, downstream, interventions also suggests the question of what it is in particular that the anxious are doing wrong at the level of discrete behavior. Our exploration of behavioral mechanisms in Study 3 offers two initial avenues for further investigation: First, it appears that the vocal modality is an important channel through which manifest anxiety is being communicated. This is especially interesting as this may be a modality over which it is difficult to exert conscious control. Second, it appears that more anxious participants are demonstrating poor social skills, and having awkward, poorly synchronized interactions. Although problematic, these behaviors may be malleable and amenable to coaching, potentially more easily than are the underlying mental states.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We have focused in the present research on interpersonal behaviors that lead to failure in the face of relational opportunities, but the reverse is an equally interesting question: How can one successfully capitalize on a relational opportunity? Social psychological research has highlighted several variables as keys to attraction and liking in initial interactions: Physical attractiveness (e.g., 
          McClure et al. 2010; 
          Walster, Aronson, Abrahams, &amp; Rottman, 1966), reciprocity of liking (e.g., 
          Beckman &amp; Secord, 1959; 
          Eastwick, Finkel, Mochon, &amp; Ariely, 2007), and similarity (e.g., 
          Byrne, 1961; 
          Klohnen &amp; Luo, 2003). Evolutionary theories have also focused on physical attractiveness, as well as warmth and status (e.g., 
          Fletcher, Simpson, Thomas, &amp; Giles, 1999; 
          Li, Bailey, Kenrick, &amp; Linsenmeier, 2002). The self-presentation literature would offer the constellation of behaviors involved in ingratiation: Conforming with and enhancing the other as well as strategic self-presentation (e.g., 
          Jones, 1975, 
          1990). The displays and behaviors that we found to be associated with attachment anxiety would compromise all of the above: Disengaging is not pursuing ingratiation. Disengagement is antithetical to warmth and would not allow one to communicate similarity or reciprocated liking. Being manifestly anxious would likewise communicate neither liking nor status, and awkward, socially unskilled behavior that is uncoordinated with the partner would not facilitate ingratiation. Finally, our findings in Studies 1 and 3 were above and beyond the effects of physical attractiveness—indeed, the findings suggest that perceptions of attractiveness are negatively distorted by anxious, awkward behavior.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Finally, a consideration that has not been addressed in the present research is how the attachment style of the potential partner might affect relationship initiation. Research has started to examine attachment effects on attraction and partner choice (
          Birnbaum &amp; Reis, 2012; 
          Frazier, Byer, Fischer, Wright, &amp; DeBord, 1996; 
          Klohnen &amp; Luo, 2003), testing hypotheses about complementarity (e.g., anxious–avoidant pairing) and similarity (e.g., anxious–anxious pairing) as well as more general effects of security or insecurity. We did not pursue the dyadic question as it was not directly relevant to our present investigation of how attachment anxiety leads to interpersonal failure. Of the studies presented here, only the speed-dating data set would include information about the attachment of the potential partner. We speculate that speed-dating a secure partner would be similar to the interactions with our warm, friendly confederate in Study 3—that is, less helpful in enabling anxiously attached people to overcome their insecurities than we might hope. Ideally, as relationship initiation research continues to expand, it will become more dyadic, similar to the progression made by research on established relationships.

They are seen as less appealing and less attractive than they might objectively deserve, and they are less often pursed as potential partners. Unfortunately, these negative relationship initiation outcomes are likely to reinforce and exacerbate the negative expectations underpinning their state social anxiety and will keep individuals high in attachment anxiety from developing the new, satisfying relationships that might help them to overcome their relational insecurity.</p><a id="psp-106-1-89-R" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_151" title="Footnotes">Footnotes</a></span><a id="fn1" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><sup>1</sup> These represent two of the four samples reported in

We retained this dimension in subsequent studies but still did not find correlations with attachment anxiety. We also assessed submissiveness because of its potential association with attachment anxiety, but we did not expect submissiveness to be a reliable deterrent to initial interpersonal success (
          Gilbert, 2001; 
          Simpson, Gangestad, &amp; Biek, 1993). Indeed, although attachment anxiety was associated with submissiveness across the three studies, it did not predict negative outcomes. Given that our interest was in the mechanisms whereby more anxiously attached people were experiencing social failure, and that submissiveness does not predict failure, we do not report on it further in the present manuscript.

          Mikulincer &amp; Shaver, 2007a). We used the Ten-Item Personality Inventory (
          Gosling, Rentfrow, &amp; Swann, 2003), which includes two items for neuroticism (α = .66). Neuroticism did not explain the association between attachment anxiety and speed-dating success for either outcome: When we added neuroticism as a covariate, it did not explain additional variance and attachment anxiety was still significant. We then turned to the interpersonal display that was associated with attachment anxiety, namely, manifest anxiety: Neuroticism was a marginal predictor of manifest anxiety, above and beyond attachment anxiety (
          <em>b</em> = .11, 
          <em>p</em> = .053); the interaction between gender and anxiety predicting manifest anxiety remained significant covarying for neuroticism. For males, when both attachment anxiety and neuroticism were included in the same model, both neuroticism and anxiety dropped to trends (anxiety: 
          <em>b</em> = .22, 
          <em>p</em> = .14; neuroticism: 
          <em>b</em> = .16,
