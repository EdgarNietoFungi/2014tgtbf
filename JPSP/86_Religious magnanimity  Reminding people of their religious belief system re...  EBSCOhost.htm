Across religious affiliations, participants reported that their religious belief systems encourage magnanimous behavior. In addition, priming their religious belief systems caused them to act more magnanimously, but only when motivated to adhere to salient ideals (i.e., after threats; see Gailliot, Stillman, Schmeichel, Maner, &amp; Plant, 2008; Jonas et al., 2008). Specifically, in Studies 1–5, we found that a general religious belief system prime (“Which religious belief system do you identify with?”) reduced the hostility of people’s thoughts, behaviors, and judgments following threat. In Studies 6 and 7, we found that the religious belief system prime only reduced hostile reactions to threat among participants who held religious beliefs that oriented them toward magnanimous ideals (Study 6) and who were dispositionally inclined to adhere to their ideals (Study 7). In Study 8, we found support for the role of magnanimous ideals by demonstrating that directly priming these ideals yielded effects similar to those produced by a religious belief system prime. These studies provide consistent evidence that, by invoking magnanimous ideals, a religious belief system prime promotes less hostile responses to threat.

According to some, religion promotes a variety of prosocial behaviors, including compassion, selflessness, cooperation, and generosity (
        Armstrong, 2006; 
        Irons, 1991; 
        Myers, 2008; 
        Putnam &amp; Campbell, 2010; 
        Shariff, Norenzayan, &amp; Henrich, 2010). Others argue that religion promotes antisocial behaviors, such as violence, intolerance, and the worst of human atrocities (
        Dawkins, 2006; 
        Harris, 2004; 
        Hitchens, 2007). Although brutalities have been perpetrated in the name of religion and religious zeal can sometimes be violent, we propose that people generally associate their religious belief system with magnanimous ideals.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">To be magnanimous is to eschew vengefulness and be generous in forgiving (
        “Magnanimous,” n.d.). In the present research, we examined the relation between religion and magnanimity by simply reminding people of their religious belief system. We assessed whether these reminders would cause participants to respond with greater magnanimity to threats that tend to elicit hostility when religious beliefs are not salient. We hypothesized that reminding people of their religious belief system would activate their pre-existing magnanimous religious ideals. People facing a threat would then adhere to their religious ideals by reacting to the threat in a more magnanimous, non-hostile manner.
      </p><a id="psp-107-3-432-ENDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_7" title="Palliative Reactions to Threat">Palliative Reactions to Threat</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">For decades, social psychologists have studied how people respond to threats they are unable to eliminate. The general finding is that people react to such threats (e.g., mortality salience, personal uncertainty, loss of control) by adhering to other commitments, including their ideals, worldviews, and meanings (e.g., 
        Burke, Martens, &amp; Faucher, 2010; 
        Kay, Gaucher, Napier, Callan, &amp; Laurin, 2008; 
        I. McGregor, Zanna, Holmes, &amp; Spencer, 2001; 
        Proulx &amp; Heine, 2008; 
        van den Bos, 2001). Recent attempts to provide a unifying account of the threat literature construe threats as triggering primal neural processes related to distress, and the reactions as palliative attempts to mute that distress (
        Jonas et al., 2014; 
        I. McGregor, 2006; 
        I. McGregor, Nash, Mann, &amp; Phills, 2010; 
        Nash, McGregor, &amp; Prentice, 2011; 
        Proulx &amp; Heine, 2008; 
        Proulx, Inzlicht, &amp; Harmon-Jones, 2012; 
        Randles, Heine, &amp; Santos, 2013). In other words, when unable to directly remove the source of threat, people can attempt to dispel feelings of distress by increasing their commitment to secure beliefs (
        I. McGregor, Nash, Mann, &amp; Phills, 2010; 
        Proulx &amp; Heine, 2008; 
        Proulx et al., 2012).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Unfortunately, people often attempt to mute their distress by adhering to other commitments in a rigid, hostile, or self-serving manner. For example, various threats cause hostile worldview defense—the bolstered support of culturally sanctioned values and derogation of those who violate normative ideals (
        Greenberg, Schimel, Martens, Solomon, &amp; Pyszcznyski, 2001; 
        Greenberg, Solomon, &amp; Pyszczynski, 1997; 
        Hart, Shaver, &amp; Goldenberg, 2005). Similarly, threats cause egocentric reactions that demean the relative value and perspective of others (
        Dechesne et al., 2003; 
        Dunning &amp; Beauregard, 2000; 
        I. McGregor &amp; Marigold, 2003; 
        I. McGregor, Nail, Marigold, &amp; Kang, 2005). Threats even induce militancy and punitive behavior: People experiencing threat are more likely to endorse military aggression against potentially antagonistic nations (
        Hastings &amp; Shaffer, 2005; 
        Hirschberger, Pyszczynski, &amp; Ein-Dor, 2009; 
        Pyszczynski et al., 2006), are more aggressive toward people who violate their worldviews (
        H. A. McGregor et al., 1998), and dole out harsher punishments against moral transgressors (
        Proulx &amp; Heine, 2008). Finally, threats increase people’s focus on a principle of justice (
        Miedema, van den Bos, &amp; Vermunt, 2006; 
        van den Bos, 2001). This focus on justice is not necessarily hostile, but can sometimes result in hostile outcomes such as victim blaming or desire for revenge (
        Kaiser, Vick, &amp; Major, 2004; 
        Lerner &amp; Miller, 1978; 
        Schumann &amp; Ross, 2010; 
        van den Bos &amp; Maas, 2009).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">These hostile reactions to threat typically occur in the absence of constraining cues. However, people’s responses to threat can be guided by currently salient ideals (
        Gailliot, Stillman, Schmeichel, Maner, &amp; Plant, 2008; 
        Greenberg, Simon, Pyszczynski, Solomon, &amp; Chatel, 1992; 
        Jonas et al., 2008). For example, a mortality salience threat decreases willingness to help following the activation of 
        <em>pro-self</em> ideals, but increases willingness to help following the activation of 
        <em>pro-social</em> ideals (
        Jonas et al., 2008).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In light of this past work on salient ideals and our premise that most people’s ambient religious beliefs are magnanimous, we reasoned that increasing the salience of people’s religious belief system would cause them to act in line with their religious ideals as a palliative reaction to threat. Adhering to religious ideals would be palliative for people experiencing a threat because focusing on ideals and values can mute distress (e.g., 
        Cohen &amp; Sherman, 2014; 
        Creswell et al., 2005; 
        Koole, Smeets, van Knippenberg, &amp; Dijksterhuis, 1999; 
        I. McGregor, 2006).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Although several past studies have examined the consequences of making religious beliefs salient under threat (
        Golec de Zavala, Cichocka, Orehek, &amp; Abdollahi, 2012; 
        Jonas &amp; Fischer, 2006; 
        Rothschild, Abdollahi, &amp; Pyszczynski, 2009), these studies used primes that activated specific prosocial or antisocial injunctions or religious beliefs. For example, in one set of studies, presenting Christian Americans or Muslim Iranians with compassionate teachings from their respective religions (e.g., “Love your neighbour as yourself”; “Do goodness to others because Allah loves those who do good,” respectively) reduced their hostility toward outgroups (
        Rothschild et al., 2009). In contrast, however, providing participants with vengeful religious passages (e.g., “The LORD commanded Israel to take arms against their brothers and chasten them before the LORD”) caused them to deliver more aggressive noise blasts against their experiment partner (
        Bushman, Ridge, Das, Key, &amp; Busath, 2007).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In the present studies, we extended this past work by testing whether a mere reminder of one’s religious belief system could similarly reduce hostility after threat. Unlike religion primes that explicitly emphasize either prosocial or antisocial religious teachings (e.g., 
        Bushman et al., 2007; 
        Rothschild et al., 2009), the religious belief system prime was stripped of any explicit religious teachings or values that might guide behavior in either a magnanimous or hostile direction. As such, it allowed us to assess whether participants’ personal religious beliefs were spontaneously magnanimous. Further, unlike God primes, which activate images of God as an omnipotent, omniscient moral agent (e.g., 
        Preston &amp; Ritter, 2010; 
        Shariff &amp; Norenzayan, 2007), or religious group primes, which activate ingroup protection motives (e.g., 
        Ginges, Hansen, &amp; Norenzayan, 2009; 
        Preston &amp; Ritter, 2010), we expected a religious belief system prime to activate core ideals associated with participants’ religious beliefs. This minimal priming procedure thus allowed us to tap the content of participants’ pre-existing religious beliefs to test our hypothesis that religious belief salience tends to cause less hostile reactions to threat. This hypothesis was based on the premise that many people’s religious beliefs revolve around magnanimous ideals.
      </p><a id="psp-107-3-432-EMDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_15" title="Magnanimous Religion?">Magnanimous Religion?</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Religion is a complex, multifaceted phenomenon that has diverse effects on behavior (
        Galen, 2012; 
        Preston &amp; Ritter, 2010). In support of a prosocial facet of religion, correlational research indicates that religious people tend to be more charitable (
        Center for Global Prosperity, 2007; 
        Putnam &amp; Campbell, 2010), empathic (
        Markstrom, Huey, Stiles, &amp; Krause, 2010), forgiving (
        McCullough &amp; Willoughby, 2009), cooperative (
        Ruffle &amp; Sosis, 2006), helpful (
        B. G. Smith &amp; Stark, 2009), and likely to volunteer (
        Caputo, 2009; 
        Ruiter &amp; DeGraaf, 2006). More religious people are also less aggressive (
        Landau, Björkqvist, Lagerspetz, Österman, &amp; Gideon, 2002; 
        Saroglou, Pichon, Trompette, Verschueren, &amp; Dernelle, 2005) and less likely to engage in criminal behavior (
        Baier &amp; Wright, 2001). Importantly, experimental studies have also demonstrated that implicitly primed religious concepts (e.g., God, heaven, holy) decrease revenge (
        Saroglou, Corneille, &amp; Van Cappellen, 2009) and increase generosity (
        Ahmed &amp; Salas, 2011; 
        Shariff &amp; Norenzayan, 2007), honesty (
        Randolph-Seng &amp; Nielsen, 2007), helping behavior (
        Pichon, Boccato, &amp; Saroglou, 2007, Study 1), and the accessibility of prosocial concepts (
        Pichon et al., 2007, Study 2).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In contrast to these prosocial associations, research has also identified a dark facet to religion. Some forms of religiosity are associated with prejudice toward various outgroups (
        Hunsberger &amp; Jackson, 2005; 
        Rowatt et al., 2006), a relation also observed in priming studies (
        Johnson, Rowatt, &amp; LaBouff, 2010; 
        LaBouff, Rowatt, Johnson, &amp; Finkle, 2012). Several surveys with Palestinians have revealed that frequency of Mosque attendance (but not frequency of prayer) predicts support for suicide attacks (
        Ginges et al., 2009). Further, implicitly primed religious concepts increase vengeful behavior if revenge is recommended by an authority figure (
        Saroglou et al., 2009), and priming vengeful religious teachings increases aggression toward a fellow participant (
        Bushman et al., 2007).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">It is perhaps not surprising that religion is associated with such divergent outcomes. Religion has many different dimensions (e.g., intrinsic vs. extrinsic: 
        Allport &amp; Ross, 1967; coalitional vs. spiritual: 
        Saroglou, 2013), and religious messages are often highly contextualized. In many religious texts, one can find passages that prescribe opposite behaviors. Concerning magnanimity, for example, many religious texts both explicitly endorse revenge (e.g., “If anyone injures his neighbor, whatever he has done must be done to him: fracture for fracture, eye for an eye, tooth for tooth”; Leviticus 24:19–20) and explicitly prohibit it (e.g., “You have heard that it was said, ‘Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.’ But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also”; Matthew 5:38). These mixed messages may help explain why religion is associated with both magnanimous and hostile behavior (
        McCullough &amp; Willoughby, 2009; 
        Saroglou et al., 2009).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The apparent contradictions in religious doctrines suggest that people might have mixed religious representations with equally dominant prosocial and antisocial themes. However, various scholars argue that religious endorsements of violence and retribution are surpassed by the more paramount religious theme of compassion and magnanimity (
        Armstrong, 2009; 
        Myers, 2008; 
        H. Smith, 1986). Indeed, the Golden Rule—the prescription to “do unto others as you would have done unto you”—holds a central position in all major world religions
        <a id="b-fn1"> </a><sup /> (
        Armstrong, 2008; 
        Batson, Schoenrade, &amp; Ventis, 1993; 
        Baumard &amp; Boyer, 2013). This maxim is so central to the world’s religions that the 
        Council for a Parliament of the World’s Religions (1993) declared it as a key cross-religion principle.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Reflecting the centrality of the Golden Rule, our preliminary data suggest that people regard the Golden Rule as a chief religious ideal. On a 7-point scale (1 = 
        <em>not at all</em>, 7 = 
        <em>very much</em>), undergraduate participants (20 Christian, 20 Muslim, 7 Sikh, 5 Hindu, 5 Jewish) indicated that their religious belief system strongly encourages the Golden Rule (
        <em>M</em> = 6.11, 
        <em>SD</em> = 1.45), and this perception did not appear to differ as a function of participants’ religious group.
        <a id="b-fn2"> </a><sup /> People also regard specific magnanimous ideals as central to their religious belief system. On 5-point scales (1 = 
        <em>not at all</em>, 5 = 
        <em>a lot</em>), undergraduate participants (34 Christian, 35 Muslim, 36 Jewish) rated the extent to which their own religion encouraged forgiveness, turning the other cheek, and eye for an eye revenge. All three groups rated their religion as being significantly more supportive of forgiveness and turning the other cheek than of revenge (see 
        Table 1). Together, these findings suggest that people strongly associate their religious beliefs system with magnanimous ideals, such as the superordinate ideal of the Golden Rule and the more specific ideals of forgiveness and refraining from revenge.

We expected this prime to activate participants’ magnanimous religious ideals. Participants with heightened motivation to adhere to these ideals for palliative reasons—those experiencing a threat—would consequently act in accordance with these ideals. In contrast, when religious beliefs were not made salient, we expected participants to respond to threat with the types of hostile reactions that typically occur after threat (
        Heine, Proulx, &amp; Vohs, 2006; 
        Hirschberger et al., 2009; 
        Proulx et al., 2012; 
        Pyszczynski, Rothschild, &amp; Abdollahi, 2008). We therefore hypothesized that, compared to people receiving no prime, people primed with their religious belief system would respond to threat with less hostility.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Importantly, because we expected people to increase their adherence to ideals as a palliative reaction to threat, we predicted that a religious belief system prime would promote magnanimous behavior only under threatening conditions. This prediction is contrary to evidence from past work demonstrating diverse prosocial effects of religion primes under neutral circumstances (

        Randolph-Seng &amp; Nielsen, 2007; 
        Shariff &amp; Norenzayan, 2007). These past studies typically prime participants with religious concepts by using scrambled sentence or lexical decision tasks (e.g., God, heaven, salvation) or by placing participants in a religious context, such as a chapel. Several studies now suggest that such primes increase prosocial behavior, at least in part, by inducing feelings of supernatural surveillance (
        Gervais &amp; Norenzayan, 2012; 
        Shariff &amp; Norenzayan, 2007; see also 
        Saroglou et al., 2009, in which religion primes increased deference to authority). In essence, these primes might promote prosociality by reminding people that the moral nature of their behavior is being monitored and judged.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Because we expected a religious belief system prime to activate core ideals that participants associate with their religious beliefs (rather than feelings of supernatural surveillance), we based our predictions on past research examining the effects of salient norms and ideals after threat. This research has demonstrated that activated norms and ideals often only promote behavior consistent with these norms and ideals when participants have been threatened and are thus motivated to affirm other commitments (
        Gailliot et al., 2008; 
        Greenberg et al., 1992; 
        Jonas et al., 2008; 
        Rothschild et al., 2009). For example, in four studies using different types of prosocial norm primes (e.g., egalitarianism; helping) and different priming methods (e.g., explicit statements of the norm; situational cues of the norm), 
        Gailliot et al. (2008) found that the salient norms only increased norm-consistent behavior after a mortality salience induction. 
        Jonas et al. (2008) reported a similar pattern in three of four studies on the effects of priming diverse prosocial concepts after mortality salience threats, and 
        Rothschild et al. (2009) demonstrated that salient compassionate religious ideals only reduced support for military force and anti-Western attitudes after mortality salience threats.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">These studies provide strong evidence that people are more likely to adhere to salient norms and ideals when they are motivated to dispel the distress caused by threat. We therefore predicted that people would be most likely to adhere to their religious ideals when (a) these ideals were activated by a religious belief system prime, and (b) they were motivated to affirm a secure commitment. In support of this prediction, in a preliminary study we found that people who had been primed with their religious belief system only increased their dedication to their religion when they also experienced a threat. We conducted this preliminary study with 132 undergraduates (72 Christian, 22 Muslim, 15 Hindu, 8 Buddhist, 4 Sikh, 1 Jewish, 10 “other”) and examined the joint effects of a religious belief system prime (“Which religious belief system do you most identify with?”) and a standard mortality salience threat (see Study 1) on a seven-item scale of religious dedication (e.g., “I aspire to live and act according to my religious beliefs”; 
        I. McGregor, Nash, &amp; Prentice, 2010; α = .90).
        <a id="b-fn3"> </a><sup /> We found a significant interaction between prime and threat, 
        <em>F</em>(1, 128) = 4.96, 
        <em>p</em> = .03, η
        p<sup>2</sup> = .04. After experiencing the mortality salience threat, participants who had been primed with their religious belief system (
        <em>M</em> = 3.89, 
        <em>SD</em> = 0.79) indicated greater religious dedication relative to participants who had not been primed (
        <em>M</em> = 3.29, 
        <em>SD</em> = 0.87), 
        <em>F</em>(1, 128) = 7.98, 
        <em>p</em> = .006, 
        <em>d</em> = 0.72. In the absence of threat, however, participants in the religious belief system prime (
        <em>M</em> = 3.50, 
        <em>SD</em> = 0.78) and no prime (
        <em>M</em> = 3.53, 
        <em>SD</em> = 0.80) conditions did not differ, 
        <em>F</em>(1, 128) = 0.03, 
        <em>p</em> = .86, 
        <em>d</em> = 0.04. Further, among participants who had been primed, those in the threat condition indicated greater religious dedication relative to those in the no threat condition, 
        <em>F</em>(1, 128) = 3.85, 
        <em>p</em> = .05, 
        <em>d</em> = 0.50. Among participants who had not been primed, those in the threat and no threat conditions did not differ, 
        <em>F</em>(1, 128) = 1.43, 
        <em>p</em> = .23, 
        <em>d</em> = 0.29. These findings thus provide evidence that a religious belief system prime increases commitment and adherence to personal religious beliefs, but only in the face of threat.

We focused primarily on magnanimity in the form of reduced hostility toward offending others. In Studies 1–5, we assessed the combined effect of a religious belief system prime and threat on the magnanimity of participants’ subsequent thoughts, behaviors, and judgments. In Study 1, we assessed the cognitive accessibility of magnanimous words. In Study 2, we assessed magnanimous behavior toward an offending outgroup. In Studies 3 and 4, we assessed magnanimity toward corporate criminals. In Study 5, we assessed magnanimity toward a cultural critic.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Next, in Studies 6–7, we attempted to further explain our effects using pertinent individual difference moderators. In Study 6, we examined whether a religious belief system prime promotes magnanimity under threat particularly for people who associate their religious belief system with the Golden Rule. In Study 7, we examined whether a religious belief system prime promotes magnanimity under threat particularly for people who are dispositionally promotion-focused, and thus especially committed to living up to their ideals. If, as we propose, religious magnanimity is driven by the motivated adherence to religious ideals in threatening circumstances, then the effect should be strongest among participants who hold religious beliefs that orient them toward magnanimous ideals (Study 6) and who are dispositionally inclined to adhere to their ideals (Study 7).</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Finally, in Study 8, we sought more direct evidence for our hypothesis that the religious belief system prime activates magnanimous ideals. We manipulated the proposed mediator by replacing the religious belief system prime with a magnanimous ideals prime, and we tested whether this ideals prime showed effects similar to those obtained for the religious belief system prime in earlier studies.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">To our knowledge, all existing studies examining the effects of religion in threatening circumstances have used mortality salience manipulations (
        Golec de Zavala et al., 2012; 
        Jonas &amp; Fischer, 2006; 
        Norenzayan, Dar-Nimrod, Hansen, &amp; Proulx, 2009; 
        Rothschild et al., 2009), as have all studies examining the effects of norm or ideal salience under threat (
        Gailliot et al., 2008; 
        Greenberg et al., 1992; 
        Jonas et al., 2008; 
        Rothschild et al., 2009). Following a recent review of threat and defense research indicating that any threat should cause similar defensive outcomes (
        Jonas et al., 2014), we used two different threats (mortality salience and academic uncertainty) to eliminate the possibility of a unique relation between religion and mortality salience, and to broaden the interpretation to threatening circumstances more generally.

Next, participants studied a list of revenge and forgiveness words. They were subsequently asked to recall as many words as possible. We expected threatened participants who had been primed with their religious belief system to recall fewer revenge words and more forgiveness words, as this would represent greater cognitive accessibility of magnanimous concepts (

Participants were told the purpose of the study was to examine whether verbal fluency could be determined from various exercises, such as word recall and descriptions of life events. Participants first completed a demographics section, including their age, gender, and university major. Half the participants were randomly assigned to the religious belief system prime, which asked “Which religious belief system do you most identify with?” They were then provided with a list of major religious belief systems from which they chose their own. They also had the option of responding agnostic, atheist, or “other.” The remaining participants were not asked about their religious belief system.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Half of participants then experienced a standard mortality salience threat (
            Pyszczynski, Greenberg, &amp; Solomon, 1999). Participants randomly assigned to the threat condition described the emotions that thinking of their own death aroused in them and their thoughts about what will happen to their bodies as they physically die. Participants randomly assigned to the control condition described the emotions that a painful visit to the dentist aroused in them and their thoughts about unpleasant or painful experiences at the dentist (
            Arndt, Greenberg, Solomon, Pyszczynski, &amp; Simon, 1997). All participants then completed a 5-min thought-record session to provide a delay for the mortality salience manipulation to take effect (
            Pyszczynski et al., 1999). Participants were told that we were interested in how their personality relates to their style of thinking, and they were asked to record their thoughts as they let their minds wander.

            Cameron et al. (2010). They were told they would have 1 min to study 21 words, after which they would be given a recall test. To assess the accessibility of magnanimous concepts, we included seven revenge words (
            <em>retaliate, hostility, punishing, angry, vengeful, resentful, animosity</em>), seven forgiveness words (
            <em>forgiving, compassionate, kind, tolerant, generous, reconcile, merciful</em>), and seven filler words (
            <em>silky, reservation, watercolor, software, ponder, occupation, succulent</em>). The words from the three categories were matched for both word length (
            <em>M</em>overall = 8.48 letters, 
            <em>SD</em>overall = 2.23, 
            <em>p</em>s &gt; .79) and word frequency per million words (

            <em>SD</em>overall = 128.23, 
            <em>p</em>s &gt; .33). After the words had been presented for 1 min, participants were automatically advanced to the next page for the recall test. They were provided with 21 text boxes to input as many words as they could recall and were instructed to click “submit” when they were finished. We summed the number of revenge words recalled to create a 
            <em>revenge accessibility</em> score, and we summed the number of forgiveness words recalled to create a 
            <em>forgiveness accessibility</em> score. We also summed the number of filler words recalled to create a filler word recall score. After completing the recall test, participants answered an online suspicion check, and then they read a debriefing and thank you letter.

These findings present the possibility that, in threatening circumstances, the religious belief system prime causes people to withhold hostility, but does not necessarily cause people to act more prosocially toward others. That is, on a continuum of magnanimity, the prime may move people from the hostile end of the continuum (revenge, harm others) to the middle of the continuum (decreased revenge, do no harm), but it may not take them all the way to the opposite end of the continuum (forgiveness, help others). We discuss this possibility more thoroughly in the General Discussion.

Participants (all female) read that male clubs received a greater proportion of the funds (70%) than female clubs received (30%).

Response options ranged from a 50/50 split between female and male clubs to a 100/0 split (with female clubs receiving the advantage), increasing in intervals of 5% (e.g., 55/45, 60/40, etc.).

Threatened participants selected a less vengeful distribution of funds if they had been previously reminded of their religious belief system. In fact, exposure to the religious belief system prime reduced the number of participants who chose to take some form of revenge (i.e., did not select the 50/50 split) after threat by 38%. This study thus demonstrates that a religious belief system prime can reduce vengeful behavior following threat.</p><a id="psp-107-3-432-EHDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_66" title="Study 3">Study 3</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Past research has demonstrated that participants behave more aggressively after reading a passage describing God as vengeful (
        Bushman et al., 2007). However, this effect occurs under neutral circumstances, when participants are not motivated to adhere to their religious ideals. In Study 3, we examined the robustness of the prime effect under threat by pairing the religious belief system prime with either a message of “turning the other cheek,” or a message of taking an “eye for an eye.” We tested whether participants’ religious ideals would be strong enough to override a salient revenge message (“eye for an eye”). We posit that the religious belief system prime causes threatened participants to adhere to the magnanimous ideals they associate with their personal religious beliefs; therefore, we thought these participants might reject messages (such as an “eye for an eye”) that seem contrary to these superordinate religious ideals. We thus expected the effect of the religious belief system prime to hold whether or not participants also received the “turn the other cheek” or “eye for an eye” message.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In this study, we also used a different, more unambiguously hostile measure of revenge, as it could be argued that participants who voted for an uneven distribution of funds (e.g., 70/30) in Study 2 were pursuing a principle of fairness rather than revenge toward an offending outgroup. In March 2009, the American International Group (AIG)—which had recently received $170 billion in U.S. taxpayer bailouts—was planning to pay $218 million in bonuses to employees of its financial division. The proposed bonuses sparked public outrage (
        “AIG Bonus Payments Controversy,” n.d.). Shortly after the bonus payments controversy occurred, we asked participants to indicate their endorsement of revenge against AIG executives who had accepted sizeable bonuses.

They then completed several individual difference measures consistent with the cover story. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three prime conditions: religious belief system prime paired with a “turn the other cheek” message, religious belief system prime paired with an “eye for an eye” message, and no prime control (containing neither message nor the religious belief system prime). Participants exposed to the “turn the other cheek” message read that we were interested in how religious beliefs, such as “turning the other cheek,” are related to personality. Participants exposed to the “eye for an eye” message read that we were interested in how religious beliefs, such as taking “an eye for an eye” after being harmed, are related to personality. As in Studies 1 and 2, participants in the two conditions receiving the religious belief system prime were then asked to indicate the religious belief system with which they most identified. Participants in the no prime condition were not asked about their religious belief system. Participants then completed either the threat (mortality salience) or control (dental pain) materials identical to those used in the previous studies.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Next, participants read a commentary on the AIG controversy that had ostensibly been taken from a recent news article. Following a summary of the bonus scandal, participants read about actual reactions from the American public and public officials. For example, they read that bonus recipients had been threatened with death by piano wire and guillotine. Participants read that behavioral economists believe that the impulse for revenge is an “important built-in protection that helps keep social cooperation from breaking down,” and that the widespread rage and desire for revenge against AIG executives might be natural. We included this justification of revenge to reduce the likelihood that participants would attempt to impression-manage by responding in a non-vengeful manner. However, the revenge being discussed in the article was clearly hostile revenge rather than retribution in the pursuit of fairness.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Participants then responded to six questions designed to assess their support for revenge in the context of the article (e.g., “To what extent do you agree with those advocating for some form of revenge against executives who received bonuses after their company received bailout funds?”; “To what extent do you agree with the New York Times’ conclusion that revenge is an important built-in protection against those who take more than their fair share?”). Participants indicated their responses on 9-point scales, with higher scores reflecting greater endorsement of revenge. Participants’ responses across the six questions were averaged to create a reliable index of endorsement of revenge (α = .83). Finally, participants completed an online suspicion check and then read a debriefing and thank you letter.</p><a id="psp-107-3-432-EBHDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Results</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">A 3 (religious belief system prime plus “turn the other cheek” message vs. religious belief system prime plus “eye for an eye” message vs. no prime control) × 2 (threat vs. control) ANOVA on endorsement of revenge revealed a significant interaction,

To broaden the interpretation of our findings to threats more generally (following 
        Proulx et al., 2012), we turned to an academic uncertainty manipulation in Study 4 to examine the interaction between our religious belief system prime and a different threat. In past research, this academic uncertainty threat has caused distress and adherence to personal, political, and religious values and ideals (

            Pedhazur, 1982, pp. 639–640). Key sentences were deleted to render the passage even more confusing. Participants randomly assigned to the control condition read a straightforward introductory statistics passage from an undergraduate textbook. To ensure participants read the passage (and to focus their attention on their level of understanding), participants were asked to indicate how much they understood the information in the passage at seven different points.

Worldview defense—the tendency to derogate people who criticize or violate one’s own cultural norms, values, or ideals—is one of the most robust hostile consequences of threat reported in the literature. Using a variety of threats (e.g., mortality salience, belongingness, theft salience), researchers have demonstrated that people defend their worldview to gain relief from threat-induced distress (e.g., 
        Arndt &amp; Greenberg, 1999; 
        Greenberg et al., 1992; 
        Heine et al., 2006; for review and mechanism of relief, see 
        Jonas et al., 2014; 
        Proulx et al., 2012). We examined whether the religious belief system prime would decrease the amount of worldview defense exhibited by participants under threat. In past research, worldview defense following mortality salience was mitigated by intrinsic religiosity—an internalized form of religious belief where faith is an end in itself (
        Jonas &amp; Fischer, 2006, Study 2; see also 
        Norenzayan et al., 2009). In other research, worldview defense following mortality salience was mitigated by salience of highest personal values (
        Schmeichel &amp; Martens, 2005). In the present study, we assessed whether simply reminding people of their religious belief system could have a similar effect after an academic uncertainty threat. If so, this would suggest that the situational activation of religious beliefs activates the intrinsic, personal ideals that people associate with their religious belief system.

            Arndt &amp; Greenberg, 1999) to make it appropriate for Canadian participants. Participants read two short essays ostensibly written by recent immigrants to Canada. The first essay conveyed a pro-Canada attitude. For example, participants read,

            
<blockquote>In this country people have more opportunity for success than in any other and success does not depend on the group belonged to. While there are problems in any country, Canada truly is a great nation and I don’t regret my decision to come here at all.</blockquote>
The second essay conveyed a hostile attitude toward Canada and Canadians, including statements such as “Canadians are spoiled and lazy and want everything handed to them. Canada is a cold country that is insensitive to the needs and problems of foreigners. Canadians think their country is great, but it is not.”
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">After reading each essay, participants responded to five questions assessing their reaction to the essay and the author (e.g., “I think I would like the person who wrote this essay”; “I agree with this person’s opinion of Canada”). Participants provided their evaluations on 11-point scales (0 = 
            <em>strongly disagree</em>, 10 = 
            <em>strongly agree</em>). As a manipulation check, participants indicated how they felt while completing the LISREL or easy materials on the same items used in Study 4 (α = .89). They then completed an online suspicion check and read a debriefing and thank you letter.
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">To create an index of worldview defense, we first created a pro-Canada subscale by averaging responses to the five questions regarding the pro-Canada essay, and an anti-Canada subscale by averaging responses to the five questions regarding the anti-Canada essay. We then subtracted the anti-Canada subscale from the pro-Canada subscale to create a difference score that represented our measure of worldview defense (see 
            Arndt &amp; Greenberg, 1999; 
            I. McGregor et al., 2001). A larger positive difference score reflects greater rejection of the anti-Canada essay and author relative to the pro-Canada essay, and thus stronger worldview defense.

This study thus replicates the effect of our religious belief system prime on an outcome measure that is typically amplified by threat, and is the first study to show mitigation of worldview defense after a threat other than mortality salience. In the absence of threat, however, participants primed with their religious belief system showed more hostile worldview defense reactions than those not primed. A potential cause of this reversal is the nature of the religious belief system prime. Recent work by 
          Preston and Ritter (2010) indicates that religious-group primes enhance ingroup bias by activating moral concerns for ingroup protection. It is thus possible that our religious belief system prime also activates a mild form of ingroup protection. In the absence of threat—when participants were not motivated to affirm their religious ideals—this prime might have caused them to penalize an outgroup member who was challenging their worldview. After the threat, however—when participants were motivated to affirm their personal religious ideals—the prime caused participants to act in line with these ideals and respond more magnanimously.

            <em>strongly encourages</em>), participants then indicated the extent to which their religious belief system discourages or encourages “the Golden Rule (do onto others as you would have them do onto you).” They also rated the extent to which their religious belief system encourages or discourages 14 other behaviors (e.g., “monogamy”; “lying”), some of which were related to magnanimity (e.g., “forgiveness”; “revenge”). After responding to these items on their religious belief system, participants completed either the threat (mortality salience) or control (dental pain) materials used previously, followed by a 3-min thought-record delay.
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In this study we also explored participants’ emotions to determine whether the threat and prime affected feelings of magnanimity.

            <em>strongly agree</em>). Six of these emotions were vengeful (angry, resentful, hostile, hateful, vengeful, judging), and six were forgiving (compassionate, loving, caring, generous, merciful, forgiving). The six vengeful items were combined to create an index of vengeful emotions, α = .91; the six forgiving emotions with were combined to create an index of forgiving emotions, α = .90.
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Next, participants completed our dependent measure of magnanimity. Participants read six hypothetical offense scenarios depicting an offending character and a victimized character. For example, one of the scenarios read “Mark is irritable one day and runs into a neighbor. Mark really doesn’t feel like talking, so he’s very abrupt with him and blows the neighbor off.” After each scenario, participants indicated their agreement on 7-point scales (1 = 
            <em>strongly disagree</em>, 7 = 
            <em>strongly agree</em>) with three questions assessing how they thought the victim should respond (e.g., “Mark’s neighbor should . . . be angry with Mark; forgive Mark; get back at Mark”).

People who are promotion-focused tend to be guided by their “ideal selves” (
        Higgins, 1997). They are more motivated by hopes and aspirations, and their focus centers on achieving these ideals (e.g., 
        Higgins, Friedman, &amp; Shah, 1997; 
        Lockwood, Jordan, &amp; Kunda, 2002). Accordingly, in the present study we expected threatened people who are dispositionally promotion-focused to be particularly likely to adhere to the ideals they associate with their primed religious belief system.

Unexpectedly, we did not find our typical Prime × Threat interaction across the full sample. It is possible that first measuring dispositional promotion focus affected the way participants responded to our funds distribution measure, or that providing participants with an opportunity to affirm other values (see 
          <a id="b-fn7"> </a><sup>Footnote 7</sup>) weakened our experimental manipulations. However, the observed three-way interaction suggests that the combined effect of prime and threat might be most powerful for people who are chronically promotion-focused. Because these people are probably more likely to adhere to salient ideals after threat, they are more likely to act in accordance with them.

Following the approach recommended by 
        Spencer, Zanna, and Fong (2005), we manipulated the proposed mediating variable by replacing the religious belief system prime with a magnanimous ideals prime. In so doing, we were able to test whether an ideals prime produces effects similar to the religious belief system prime, reducing hostility after threat among those who are dispositionally promotion-focused.

Further, we found that threat caused non-primed people to respond with greater hostility, an effect that has frequently been found in past research (e.g., 
          Greenberg et al., 2001; 
          Proulx &amp; Heine, 2008; 
          Pyszczynski et al., 2006). In contrast, people who had been primed with their religious belief system showed the opposite response, decreasing rather than increasing their hostility after threat. The religious belief system salience prime thus served a transformational function, supplanting the tendency toward hostility after threat with a tendency toward magnanimity.

We therefore standardized the main hostility measures in all studies (except Study 6 because all participants were primed and Study 8 because we used a magnanimous ideals prime) and combined all participants to create a sample that included 257 Christians, 103 Muslims, 44 Jews, 30 Hindus, 18 Sikhs, 12 Buddhists, and 30 “other.” A 2 (religious belief system prime vs. no prime) × 2 (threat vs. control) × 7 (religious group) ANOVA yielded our typical Threat × Prime interaction,

Lower standardized means represent less hostility. The pattern of means was similar for each religious group, with less hostile behavior under threat among participants who had been primed with their religious belief system compared to participants who had not been primed. Although future research with larger samples of non-Christian religious groups is needed, these findings suggest that a religious belief system prime functions similarly across diverse religious groups. Consistent with our preliminary data on people’s perceptions of ideals encouraged by their religious belief system, it appears that people across diverse religious groups associate their religious belief system with magnanimous ideals, and act in accordance with these ideals when motivated to affirm their salient religious belief system as a palliative reaction to threat.

In Study 3, primed people responded to a mortality salience threat by reducing their endorsement of hostile revenge, regardless of whether the prime was paired with a message of “turning the other cheek,” or a message of taking an “eye for an eye.” In Study 4, primed people responded to an academic uncertainty threat by reducing their endorsement of hostile revenge. In Study 5, primed people responded to an academic uncertainty threat by exhibiting less hostile worldview defense—an outcome measure that is typically amplified by threatening circumstances. In Study 6, primed people who strongly associated their religious belief system with the Golden Rule felt more forgiving and were less supportive of hostile behavior toward offenders after a mortality salience threat. In Study 7, primed people responded to an academic uncertainty threat with reduced hostility toward an offending outgroup only if they were dispositionally promotion-focused. Finally, in Study 8, people primed directly with magnanimous ideals responded to an academic uncertainty threat with reduced hostility toward an offending outgroup if they were dispositionally promotion-focused. Together, these studies suggest that people’s religious belief systems may promote less hostile responses to life’s many conflicts and uncertainties.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The present studies used a simple reminder of people’s religious belief system to activate participants’ personal religious ideals, and assessed dependent measures with clear links to magnanimity. This research is thus the first to provide causal evidence that participants’ religious ideals are generally magnanimous, and that a religious belief system prime reduces hostile behavior in personally threatening circumstances. Although past research has provided some evidence for such a conclusion, it has been limited to mortality salience threats, has often focused on worldview defense, and has almost exclusively used primes or measures that activate specific religious beliefs or content (e.g., 
        Jonas &amp; Fischer, 2006; 
        Rothschild et al., 2009). The present research thus contributes to recent efforts to illuminate the effects of religion by demonstrating that in different threatening contexts, a mere reminder of one’s religious belief system can influence behavior in a more magnanimous direction.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We assessed magnanimity with a variety of measures, including cognitive accessibility of hostile revenge concepts (Study 1), hostile revenge behavior (Studies 2, 7, and 8), endorsement of hostile revenge in the context of a real-world event (AIG controversy; Studies 3 and 4), hostile worldview defense (Study 5), and endorsement of hostile revenge in the context of interpersonal offenses (Study 6). Each of these outcome measures has weaknesses. For example, the behavioral voting measure could be measuring adherence to a fairness principle rather than hostile revenge, and the revenge proposed against AIG executives included an element of violence, which is clearly unacceptable under most religious belief systems. Together, however, these measures tell a coherent story about the ability of a religious belief system prime to promote less hostile responses to threat.</p><a id="psp-107-3-432-EEADA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Palliative Religion</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Why might people adhere to their salient religious belief system when confronting various threats? Recent neural evidence highlights the palliative, anxiolytic function of religion (
          Inzlicht, McGregor, Hirsh, &amp; Nash, 2009; 
          Inzlicht &amp; Tullett, 2010). In two correlational studies, stronger religious zeal (Study 1) and greater belief in God (Study 2) were marked by reduced amplitude of the error-related negativity (ERN)—a neural “distress signal” that has been source localized to the anterior cingulate cortex (
          Bush, Luu, &amp; Posner, 2000; 
          Inzlicht et al., 2009). Two additional experiments revealed that conscious (Study 1) and non-conscious (Study 2) religion primes decreased ERN amplitude, but only for theists (
          Inzlicht &amp; Tullett, 2010). These studies suggest that religious beliefs can insulate people from distress.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Other research suggests that ideals may be a particular effectively way to activate approach-motivated states that have been shown to automatically downregulate distress, which may be why people are so motivated to adhere to ideals when under threat (
          I. McGregor, Gailliot, Vasquez, &amp; Nash, 2007; 
          I. McGregor, Nash, Mann, &amp; Phills, 2010; 
          I. McGregor, Nash, &amp; Prentice, 2010; 
          I. McGregor et al., 2013; 
          Nash et al., 2011; 
          Proulx et al., 2012; for a review, see 
          Jonas et al., 2014). Indeed, approach-motivation-related brain activity is negatively correlated with self-reported stress and ERN amplitude (
          Nash, Inzlicht, &amp; McGregor, 2012). Adhering to religious ideals after threat may thus be a particularly effective way of managing the distress caused by threat.

          Gervais &amp; Norenzayan, 2012, Studies 1 and 3; 
          Shariff &amp; Norenzayan, 2007, Study 2) and others showing no moderation (e.g., 
          Ahmed &amp; Salas, 2011; 
          Gervais &amp; Norenzayan, 2012, Study 2; 
          Laurin, Kay, &amp; Fitzsimons, 2012; 
          Randolph-Seng &amp; Nielsen, 2007; 
          Shariff &amp; Norenzayan, 2007, Study 1). In the current studies, we included only participants who ascribed to a religion and excluded all participants who identified themselves as atheist or agnostic. Although our sample of atheists and agnostics was small, we found that these non-believers did not show the same pattern of responding as believers. Some religious belief thus seems necessary for the religious belief system prime to activate religious ideals.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">However, among believers, the effect of the religious belief system prime after threat occurred irrespective of participants’ pre-existing levels of religiosity. We suspect that this null result occurs because most people who ascribe to a religion—regardless of how devout they are—associate their religious belief system with superordinate magnanimous ideals such as the Golden Rule. Instead of pre-existing levels of religiosity, a more relevant pre-existing religious belief appears to be how strongly they associate their religious belief system with such superordinate ideals, as evidenced in Study 6. This is not to say that pre-existing religiosity does not matter. Indeed, as demonstrated in past research showing that intrinsic religiosity moderates the effects of mortality salience threats (
          Golec de Zavala et al., 2012; 
          Jonas &amp; Fischer, 2006), levels of pre-existing religiosity likely influence whether people spontaneously adhere to their religious beliefs in threatening circumstances when these beliefs have not been experimentally primed.
        </p><a id="psp-107-3-432-ECADA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Origins of the Religion–Magnanimity Link</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The present studies provide evidence for an association between religious belief and magnanimity (at least in the form of reduced hostility)—an association that has also been found in past research (e.g., 
          McCullough &amp; Willoughby, 2009; 
          Saroglou et al., 2009). But where might this association have originated? In her book, 
          <em>The Great Transformation</em>, historian Karen 
          Armstrong (2006) argues that religions evolved, at least in part, to replace the intuitive impulse toward revenge with an impulse toward magnanimity (
          Armstrong, 2006). This view is echoed by other scholars, who posit that the religious emphasis on magnanimity evolved against a backdrop of violence (
          de Botton, 2012; 
          H. Smith, 1986). For example, according to philosopher Alain 
          de Botton (2012), “the origins of religious ethics lay in the pragmatic need of the earliest communities to control their members’ tendencies toward violence, and to foster in them contrary habits of harmony and forgiveness” (p. 79; see also 
          Eliade, 1960). A related perspective has been proposed by social psychologists, who argue that belief in moralizing high Gods—omniscient, omnipotent supernatural policing agents—emerged from a need to promote within-group cooperation in large, genetically unrelated social groups (
          Shariff et al., 2010; see also 
          Graham &amp; Haidt, 2010). Collectively, these scholars from diverse disciplines suggest that magnanimous religious values originated from a need to curb people’s tendencies toward hostility. Although there are certainly aspects of religion that stoke hostility, at a more general level religious ideals might be particularly useful at reducing hostility, as found in the present research.
        </p><a id="psp-107-3-432-EBADA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Limitations and Future Directions</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In the present research, we found convergent evidence for our hypotheses across two pilot studies and eight featured studies. However, there are limitations and unanswered questions that should be investigated in future research. One limitation of the current studies concerns the inconsistent effects we found on our manipulation check of feelings of distress (but see the meta-analyses presented in the Meta-Analyses of Manipulation Checks section). One reason for this inconsistency might be that we assessed feelings of distress at the end of the studies, after the thought record delay and dependent measures. It is possible that participants’ retrospective reports of their feelings were affected by the measures that came before it. Another possibility is that people are unable to report (or are not consciously aware of) their feelings of distress after threat. Consistent with this possibility, past research indicates that mortality salience inductions do not typically increase self-reports of negative affect that are positioned immediately after the threat (
          Pyszczynski et al., 1999). Given the cohesive effects we observed across eight studies and the consistency of these studies with the broader threat literature, it is likely that the threats used in the present studies were effective despite the inconsistent results on the manipulation checks. However, the role that distress plays in the effects of threat is a complex issue that should be examined more carefully in future research.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Another limitation of the present research concerns our dependent measures. Although we attempted to demonstrate the generality of our effects by assessing magnanimity in a variety of ways, we did not measure magnanimity in response to severe offenses (e.g., murder or terrorism) that unambiguously violate religious principles of morality. We predict, however, that a religious belief system prime would produce similar effects to those found in the present studies on responses to even severely immoral crimes. Though these crimes violate religious (and non-religious) morality, people who are motivated to affirm their salient religious belief system should still act in accordance with a superordinate principle of magnanimity, especially if they strongly associate their religious belief system with magnanimous ideals. This reasoning finds some support in past research demonstrating that intrinsic religiosity reduces support for aggressive counterterrorism following threat (
          Golec de Zavala et al., 2012). Future work could thus explore whether religious magnanimity after threat does or does not extend to people who severely violate principles of religious morality.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Future research could also investigate other possible limits to (or perhaps even reversals of) religious magnanimity after threat. Recent research on the effects of religion under neutral circumstances suggests that people’s religious prosociality might not extend to individuals or groups that violate their religious values. For example, both self-reported religiosity or belief in God (
          Edgell, Gerteis, &amp; Hartmann, 2006; 
          Gervais, Shariff, &amp; Norenzayan 2011; 
          Johnson et al., 2010, Study 1; 
          Rowatt, LaBouff, Johnson, Froese, &amp; Tsang, 2009; 
          Rowatt et al., 2006) and religion primes (
          Johnson et al., 2010, Study 2) have been associated with less accepting attitudes toward homosexuals, Muslims, and atheists. However, it is possible that the direction of the effects could change under threatening circumstances. The Golden Rule teaches the value of magnanimity toward everyone. When reminded of their religious beliefs, threatened people who hold the Golden Rule as a core religious ideal might extend religious magnanimity to everyone—even those who violate other religious values (for some support for this prediction, see 
          Golec de Zavala et al., 2012; 
          Norenzayan et al., 2009). In light of past research showing an association between religion and hostility toward various outgroups, this is an important question for future research.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">An additional question for future research concerns whether a religious belief system prime can promote more prosocial action toward others in the face of threat, in addition to reducing hostility. The current set of studies does not provide a conclusive answer to this question. In Study 1, reminding participants of their religious belief system caused them to recall fewer revenge words under threat, but did not increase their recall of forgiveness words. Because prohibitions and supernatural punishment are central to many religious beliefs (
          Norenzayan &amp; Shariff, 2008), it is possible that the religious belief system prime may primarily function by curbing hostility. However, because people also associate their religion with prosocial ideals, it seems likely that the prime can directly promote prosocial behavior, such as perspective-taking, helping, and charity. This possibility finds some support in Study 6, where we found that primed participants who strongly associated their religious belief system with the Golden Rule reported more forgiving emotions after threat. Future research assessing different outcomes of the prime in threatening circumstances could provide us with greater understanding of the scope of behaviors that are connected to people’s religious beliefs.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Finally, religion is not the only ideology that promotes magnanimous ideals, and thus not the only ideology that can promote less hostile responses to threatening circumstances. We anticipate that the salience of non-religious magnanimous ideals would produce similar effects to the religious belief system prime used in the present research. Indeed, presenting Americans with statements advocating tolerance reduced their likelihood of responding to threat by derogating a foreigner who had criticized the United States (
          Greenberg et al., 1992), and priming people with prosocial norms (e.g., pacifism, helping) increased prosocial responses to threat (
          Gailliot et al., 2008; 
          Jonas et al., 2008). In Study 8, we directly primed magnanimous ideals using a sentence-unscrambling task and found that this non-religious prime also reduced hostility under threat among participants who were dispositionally committed to adhering to their ideals. Future research should continue to explore diverse ways to reduce hostility in contexts that typically elicit it, and compare the ability of religious and secular primes to promote more magnanimous responses to threat.

This research thus contributes to the current dialogue on religion by demonstrating that a mere reminder of people’s religious belief system—one that is not accompanied by any explicit beliefs or injunctions—can promote more magnanimous, less hostile reactions in threatening contexts. Given that religious belief is an important source of meaning and well-being in so many people’s lives (
