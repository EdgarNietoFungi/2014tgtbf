In the current article, we examine power signals within interpersonal communication, exploring whether use of concrete versus abstract language is seen as a signal of power. Because power activates abstraction (e.g., Smith &amp; Trope, 2006), perceivers may expect higher power individuals to speak more abstractly and therefore will infer that speakers who use more abstract language have a higher degree of power. Across a variety of contexts and conversational subjects in 7 experiments, participants perceived respondents as more powerful when they used more abstract language (vs. more concrete language). Abstract language use appears to affect perceived power because it seems to reflect both a willingness to judge and a general style of abstract thinking.

Being seen as powerful can elicit treatment from others that allows one to actually achieve such power (
        Ridgeway, Berger, &amp; Smith, 1985; 
        Smith &amp; Galinsky, 2010). Having power means having more control over one’s own life and therefore is associated with numerous positive outcomes for the individual, including an increased ability to achieve one’s goals (e.g., 
        Galinsky, Gruenfeld, &amp; Magee, 2003; 
        Guinote, 2007; 
        Karremans &amp; Smith, 2010) and the goals of one’s organization (
        Overbeck &amp; Park, 2006), increased freedom to express oneself (e.g., 
        Anderson &amp; Berdahl, 2002), and behave in line with one’s core values (e.g., 
        Chen, Lee-Chai, &amp; Bargh, 2001; 
        DeCelles, DeRue, Margolis, &amp; Ceranic, 2012), and even an array of positive health outcomes (e.g., 
        Marmot et al., 1991; 
        Sherman et al., 2012). Thus, the possession of power is often a goal in itself. Moreover, individuals who occupy high-power positions but are not perceived as powerful risk their position being viewed as illegitimate (
        Magee &amp; Galinsky, 2008). Although some behaviors signaling power may be difficult to enact with limited resources (e.g., loaning money, exerting influence, taking action; 
        Goldhamer &amp; Shils, 1939), others may be relatively easy to adopt (e.g., a lower pitched voice; 
        Carney, Hall, &amp; Smith LeBeau, 2005). In the current article, we examine whether a person’s use of relatively concrete or abstract language can serve as a subtle but meaningful signal of power, exploring this idea across six studies that manipulate linguistic abstraction in various ways and measure power and leadership inferences.
      </p><a id="psp-107-1-41-EIDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_6" title="Linguistic Abstraction as a Power Cue">Linguistic Abstraction as a Power Cue</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Recent research on power inferences has increasingly emphasized the subtle ways that people signal their degree of power. Converging evidence suggests that when power is associated with a behavioral signal, people become sensitive to the signal itself, leading them to infer the presence of power when witnessing the associated behavior (
        Smith &amp; Galinsky, 2010). For example, 
        Galinsky et al. (2003) found that having power is associated with taking action (e.g., being more likely to act on an external stimulus, such as an annoying fan blowing in one’s direction); people’s sensitivity to this association is highlighted by their corresponding perception of those who take more action as being more powerful (
        Magee, 2009). Likewise, individuals placed in a powerful role tend to lower their voice pitch (
        Puts, Gaulin, &amp; Verdolini, 2006), and individuals asked to speak with a lower pitched voice (vs. their normal voice) not only feel more powerful (
        Stel, van Dijk, Smith, van Dijk, &amp; Djalal, 2012), but are also judged by observers as having more power (
        Puts et al., 2006; 
        Puts, Hodges, Cardenas, &amp; Gaulin, 2007).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The central premise of the current article is that a speaker’s use of more abstract language may serve as a cue that the speaker is powerful. A behavioral signal approach suggests one reason that power may be inferred from linguistic abstraction. Power triggers a broad psychological shift toward abstract processing (
        Smith &amp; Trope, 2006), whereby people in higher power roles (or who momentarily feel more powerful) increasingly construe information in an abstract fashion that captures the gist or essence of the presented information (
        Huang, Galinsky, Gruenfeld, &amp; Guillory, 2011; 
        Magee, Milliken, &amp; Lurie, 2010; 
        Smith &amp; Trope, 2006; 
        Stel et al., 2012; see also 
        Magee &amp; Smith, 2013, for a recent review). In other words, power is associated with the cognitive signal of abstract thinking. Indeed, being made to think in a more abstract manner also makes individuals feel more powerful (
        Smith, Wigboldus, &amp; Dijksterhuis, 2008). Though thought processes are sometimes considered unobservable, these cognitive effects of power can lead to different outputs that are visible to perceivers. A major example of this is linguistic communication: When discussing a topic, a speaker may express information either in a more concrete way that provides many details and emphasizes specific actions or features or in a more abstract way that captures a topic’s overall gist or meaning. For example, a speaker discussing a massive earthquake might state either that 120 people died and 400 were injured (a concrete statement conveying specific details) or that the earthquake is a national tragedy (an abstract statement conveying higher level meaning). Consistent with a general power–abstraction relationship, several studies have revealed that those high in power use more abstract language than those low in power. For example, members of a majority, high-power group used more abstract language to describe both ingroup and outgroup members than individuals who were part of the minority (
        Guinote, 2001); high-power-primed participants used more abstract language to describe actions than low-power-primed participants (
        Smith &amp; Trope, 2006); and those in positions of authority used more abstract language to describe the terrorist attacks of September 11th (
        Magee et al., 2010). Abstract language may therefore serve as a power signal, with people expecting those higher in power to speak more abstractly, and consequently perceiving people who speak more abstractly as more powerful.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Furthermore, beyond a mere association, abstract language reflects a more removed, “outside” perspective, and is highly linked with psychological distance (
        Trope &amp; Liberman, 2010). This style of speech fits our expectations of the powerful: We expect powerful people to be outside and above things, rather than in the midst of them (
        Giessner &amp; Schubert, 2007). When people use abstract language, they communicate that they are removed from the action and able to distill the gist or essence of the situation, instead of focusing on the concrete actions that would be most salient if they were “on the ground.” This ability to see the big picture is something we expect of those with power; as such, abstract language should serve as a power cue.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Moreover, one aspect of many types of abstract speech is that such speech confers judgment (
        Maass, 1999; 
        Maass, Salvi, Arcuri, &amp; Semin, 1989). Abstract language, relative to concrete language, moves further away from specific, objective, immediate physical details. To move away from these details, the speaker must make judgments about the broader meaning or implications of the situation, the broader goals of the actor or actors, and the like. For example, adjectives have been identified as more abstract linguistic categories than verbs (
        Semin &amp; Fiedler, 1988) in that they do not describe the actions that occurred but rather represent an inference about the relatively invariant characteristics of the actor. Such an inference leads adjectives to tend to connote judgment and be more strongly valenced than concrete verb descriptions (
        Semin &amp; Fiedler, 1988).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Power is also associated with being judgmental. High-power individuals are more likely to express their opinions (
        Anderson &amp; Berdahl, 2002; 
        Berdahl &amp; Martorana, 2006; 
        Galinsky, Magee, Gruenfeld, Whitson, &amp; Liljenquist, 2008) and feel more entitled to judge others (
        Goodwin, Gubin, Fiske, &amp; Yzerbyt, 2000) than low-power individuals. Moreover, other people seem to allow, and even expect, those in high-power positions to evaluate others and express judgment (e.g., 
        Foucault &amp; Gordon, 1980). People’s belief that powerful people are more judgmental may therefore be an additional mechanism supporting their use of linguistic abstraction as a cue for power.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">However, although we believe the association between linguistic abstraction and perception of power is logical for the reasons detailed above, we do not think this association is especially obvious to those who seek power. That is, although people may be aware of their expectation for those high in power to communicate the “big picture,” they may not realize that people will make meaningful inferences about a speaker’s power on the basis of his or her linguistic abstraction. Indeed, though individuals are able to use language abstraction flexibly to achieve explicit communication goals (e.g., 
        Douglas &amp; Sutton, 2003), it is not clear that communicators are always aware of their language use or its interpretation by perceivers; to the contrary, a body of research suggests that communicators often do not have an accurate sense of how their speech is interpreted by others (e.g., 
        Keysar &amp; Henly, 2002; 
        Vorauer &amp; Claude, 1998). The many past examples of speakers focusing on concrete details while hoping to seem powerful (e.g., the wonky political candidate) suggest that the idea of abstraction as a cue for power is not a trivial insight.
      </p><a id="psp-107-1-41-EHDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_14" title="Overview of the Current Studies">Overview of the Current Studies</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We tested the hypothesized effect of abstract language on power perceptions across seven experiments. First, we describe a simple pilot study testing our claim that people expect those high in power to increasingly communicate the gist of a situation, its “big picture.” Next, we describe our focal experiments, wherein we varied the abstractness of speech and had respondents make power judgments of the speaker. Across these experiments, we varied the types of speech—from phrases and single sentences (Experiments 1–2, 4–6) to short paragraphs (Experiments 3a–3b), from descriptions of simple behaviors (Experiments 1–2, 5), to consumer products (Experiments 4 and 6), to societal issues (Experiments 3a–3b), and using negative and positive statements (Experiments 1–2, 5) as well as relatively neutral ones (Experiments 3a–3b)—to test for consistency of effects. Across these different manipulations, our operationalization of abstract language always involved emphasizing gist, or capturing defining aspects of the event (see 
        Trope &amp; Liberman, 2010). In the majority of studies, we asked participants to evaluate communicators’ power explicitly, although in Experiment 4, we also added a more indirect measure of power perceptions. In Experiments 5 and 6, we explored two possible mediators of the relationship between language and perceived power: perceptions of abstract thinking and judgmentalness.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Moreover, to demonstrate that our effects are related to power specifically, in addition to assessing how abstract language affected judgments of power, we also assessed how abstract language affected judgments of two other personality dimensions: warmth and competence. 
        Douglas and Sutton (2010) found that abstract language sometimes affects likability, so we wanted to ascertain whether our effects were due to a halo effect, in which perceivers generally prefer individuals who use abstract language to individuals who use concrete language and thus evaluate individuals who use abstract language positively on a variety of traits. Competence may also be plausibly associated with the use of more abstract language. For example, action identification theory posits that individuals switch from more abstract to more concrete action identifications as they encounter difficulty in completing an action (
        Vallacher &amp; Wegner, 1987), and individuals who chronically prefer to describe actions more concretely tend to be less proficient at a variety of skilled actions (
        Vallacher &amp; Wegner, 1989). If individuals are sensitive to this association with proficiency, it is possible that they will infer competence from a general abstract style of speech. It also seems possible that the reverse effect will be obtained, given that concrete speech conveys more details and is more easily verifiable (
        Hansen &amp; Wänke, 2010) and therefore may signal knowledgeability. We therefore did not have any strong expectation for effects of abstraction on competence judgments. However, because power and competence are often related judgments (although, critically, these two characteristics are not always correlated; e.g., 
        Fast &amp; Chen, 2009), we felt it important to disentangle any effects of language on these two characteristics. Although it is plausible that abstract language will have some impact on judgments of warmth and competence, we expect it to have the most consistent, unique effects on judgments of power.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Methodologically, we set consistent exclusion criteria across studies. Because our studies involved judgments of linguistic statements, we excluded participants who did not report that English was their first language. We also excluded all participants who did not correctly answer an instructional manipulation check (IMC; 
        Oppenheimer, Meyvis, &amp; Davidenko, 2009). The IMC asked them to enter or select a specific response to a particular question in the demographics section (Experiments 1, 3a–6) or to recall which word in a list was used in the experimental materials (Experiment 2). The number of participants dropped for meeting these exclusion criteria varied somewhat across studies, although they were consistent with recent descriptions of the range of data excluded due to poor quality (3%–37%) found in published articles using Mechanical Turk (mTurk) samples (
        Chandler, Mueller, &amp; Paolacci, 2014). Consistent with the recommendations of 
        Simmons, Nelson, and Simonsohn (2011), we initially set target sample sizes such that conditions would have at least 20 participants per condition (because manipulations were primarily within subject, this meant that studies had a minimum of 20 people). Given more recent urging for researchers to increase the sample sizes they use more dramatically (e.g., 
        Simmons, Nelson, &amp; Simonsohn, 2013), studies completed later in the research process (particularly Experiments 2, 5, and 6) used much larger sample sizes.

          <em>SD</em><em>age</em> = 8.29) to indicate their general expectations about the types of things said by people high versus low in power. Participants responded to a series of bipolar items that gauged a tendency to capture the gist of the situation and focus on an event’s primary aspects, versus communicate more secondary details. More specifically, participants first indicated the extent to which they expected “someone high in power” to provide lots of details versus provide a global picture, convey mechanics or how to do something versus convey purpose or why to do something, capture supporting or secondary points versus capture essential and defining points, and focus on the particular case versus focus on the general case

          <em>provide lots of details</em>) and the last point labeled with the more abstract behavior (e.g., 
          <em>provide a global picture</em>). Participants then rated their expectations of “someone low in power” on the same series of items (α = .57). In line with the general logic of our argument, paired samples 
          <em>t</em> tests conducted on average responses to the four-item measure indicated that people expected high-power individuals (
          <em>M</em> = 5.19, 
          <em>SD</em> = 1.48) to communicate more of the gist of a situation, as compared with low-power individuals (

As past research has revealed that people make trait inferences about speakers in part based on the valence of their communications (e.g., 
        Douglas &amp; Sutton, 2010), we included both positive and negative stimuli to test whether the effect of language on power judgments would be consistent across valence. Thus, some of the pictures depicted positive behaviors, and others depicted negative behaviors. For each description of a picture, participants indicated their impression of the person who wrote the description on the dimensions of power, warmth, and competence.

          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Participants then viewed a series of pictures, each depicting a person’s behavior (e.g., a woman studying in a library).
            <a id="b-fn3"> </a><sup /> Each picture was accompanied by either a concrete or an abstract description ostensibly generated by another respondent. Concrete descriptions focused on the particular action depicted in the picture (e.g., Barbara is writing notes); abstract descriptions went beyond the particular action and provided a broader label that did not involve physical details (e.g., Barbara is working hard). That is, a person who read the concrete description could easily imagine the specific picture used, whereas a person who read the abstract description might imagine one of a variety of different pictures. Two pictures depicted negative behaviors (spray-painting graffiti, littering), and two depicted positive behaviors (writing notes, holding the door for someone). We presented, in random order, each of these four pictures twice: once with a concrete description, once with an abstract description. Thus, both valence of the behavior and language abstraction were manipulated within subjects. For each picture–description pair, participants rated the respondent on measures of power (
            <em>dominant</em>, 
            <em>powerful</em>,

First, we wanted to use an additional manipulation of abstraction: 
        Semin and Fiedler’s (1988) linguistic categorization model (LCM). This model, which has been used widely to code communications for degree of abstraction, distinguishes between four linguistic categories that fall on a continuum of abstractness, ranging from purely describing a particular observable behavior (most concrete), to providing an interpretation of that behavior, to describing states or characteristics of the actors themselves (most abstract). Thus, though the LCM specifically focuses on action-oriented words, the model’s definition of linguistic abstraction as moving beyond concrete, specific details to broader interpretations is similar to our own. According to the LCM, descriptive action verbs (e.g., 
        <em>walk</em>, 
        <em>yell</em>) are the most concrete category, followed by interpretive action verbs (e.g., 
        <em>help</em>, 
        <em>tease</em>), then state verbs (e.g., 
        <em>admire</em>, 
        <em>hate</em>), with adjectives (e.g., 
        <em>honest</em>, 
        <em>aggressive</em>) being the most abstract. In Experiment 4, participants read two persuasive messages, ostensibly written by two different respondents from a previous study, that used either relatively abstract linguistic categories (adjectives and state verbs) or relatively concrete linguistic categories (descriptive action verbs and interpretive action verbs). Participants then rated each respondent’s power, warmth, competence, and judgmentalness. Our particular manipulation also attempted to control as tightly as possible for the content that was communicated; that is, the abstract and concrete condition were constructed to essentially communicate the same thing, but were phrased differently. In addition, we wanted to explore a more behavioral consequence of power judgments. To this end, we had participants evaluate and select between the more abstract and more concrete communicator for low- and high-power roles for a future study.

Statements made by the abstract respondent (identified as “Participant D”) were constructed so that they used more adjectives and state verbs (relatively abstract linguistic categories according to the LCM). Concrete and abstract statements were constructed to communicate the same content, with linguistic abstractness being the only distinguishing factor between the two. For example, one concrete statement was “Mojo Juice is made only from fruit juice and contains no preservatives,” whereas the comparable abstract statement was “Mojo Juice is 100% juice and preservative-free.” The statements were pilot tested such that they did not differ in their persuasiveness (

The goal of Experiment 5 was to explore potential mediators of this effect. Our primary theoretical basis for the effect of linguistic abstraction on perceptions of power is the association between power and abstraction (
        Magee &amp; Smith, 2013; 
        Smith &amp; Trope, 2006) and the corollary expectation for individuals with power to be broad and abstract thinkers (see our pilot study), something that would leak out at a behavioral level in communication. In addition, many types of abstract language are seen as more judgmental than concrete language (e.g., 
        Douglas &amp; Sutton, 2006, 
        2010; 
        Semin &amp; Fiedler, 1988), which may be an additional reason for people to infer power from abstract communication. To begin to explore this latter issue and its degree of relevance for the current findings, we included measures of judgmentalness in several earlier studies. Across these experiments, we found mixed support for the assumption that abstract communicators would be seen as more judgmental (i.e., statistically significant effects in Experiments 2 and 3a, but only nonsignificant directional support in Experiments 3b and 4). We also returned to these data sets and tested whether the single-item measure of judgmentalness used in Experiments 2–4 mediated the effects of linguistic abstraction on ratings of power (following the guidelines of 
        Judd, Kenny, &amp; McClelland, 2001, for conducting within-subjects mediation analyses). Judgmentalness only emerged as a significant mediator in Experiments 2 and 4 (details of these mediation analyses are available from the authors). However, a single item is an unreliable, low-powered way to measure a construct, so we view these analyses as preliminary at best.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Thus, in Experiment 5, we explicitly and robustly tested two potential mediators of the relationship between language and perceptions of power: perceptions of the respondent as an abstract thinker and perceptions of the respondent as judgmental. As in Experiment 2, participants read descriptions, ostensibly written by different respondents, of a series of behaviors. These written responses described either the concrete means through which the behavior might be accomplished or the abstract ends achieved by completing the behavior. Unlike the previous experiments, language was manipulated between participants, so each participant saw either only concrete descriptions or only abstract descriptions. Some of the behaviors were positive and others were negative to test whether the effect of language on power judgments, as well as the effects of the two mediators, would be consistent across valence. After reading a behavior–description pair, participants responded to several items measuring perception of the respondent’s power, how much the respondent was an abstract thinker, and how judgmental the respondent was. Given that we used materials for which we already found significant effects of judgmentalness in Experiment 2, we expected judgmentalness to be a significant mediator of the relationship between language and perceptions of power. Thus, because we test a simultaneous multiple mediator model, this experiment serves as a conservative test of the mediating role of perceptions of the respondent as an abstract thinker.</p><a id="psp-107-1-41-EBCDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">One hundred seventy-one participants participated via mTurk for $0.50.

In Experiment 5, the terms we used to measure participants’ perceptions of judgmentalness (e.g., “opinionated,” “critical”) were negative in valence overall. This kind of judgmentalness may be specifically relevant when a speaker is describing people, especially when these descriptions are negative. Indeed, judgmentalness was a stronger mediator of our effects in Experiment 5 when respondents were describing negative behaviors. However, we are interested in judgmentalness more broadly, as an ability and willingness to make judgments and draw conclusions (cf. 
        Goodwin, Gubin, Fiske, &amp; Yzerbyt, 2000). In Experiment 6, we therefore again tested our multiple mediator model, exploring perceptions of the respondent as an abstract thinker and perceptions of the respondent as someone willing to make judgments as mediators of the linguistic abstraction–power judgment link. This time, however, we modified our judgmentalness measure so it neutrally assessed speakers’ perceived tendencies to make judgments and draw conclusions (i.e., their “willingness to make judgments” rather than negatively tinged “judgmentalness”). We also varied other aspects of the design from that of Experiment 5, using the stimuli from Experiment 4 (instead of those used in Experiments 2 and 5) and a within-subjects design.

After reading a message, participants responded to several items measuring perception of the respondent’s power, how much the respondent was an abstract thinker, and how willing the respondent was to make judgments. In contrast to the highly valenced materials involving individuals’ behavior used in Experiment 5, the present materials were designed to be neutral to mildly positive and were about products rather than people, allowing us to explore the applicability of our multiple mediator model to a new context. In Experiment 4, in which the same materials were used, we did not find significant effects on a single-item measure of judgmentalness, but we expected to find effects on the more nuanced, neutral measure of willingness to make judgments in the present experiment.</p><a id="psp-107-1-41-EBBDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">One hundred twenty-nine participants participated via mTurk for $0.50.

            Judd et al. (2001) for conducting within-subjects mediation analyses. In the previous paragraph, we already demonstrated that the independent variable (linguistic abstractness) had a significant impact on both mediators and the outcome variable (power ratings). We next calculated separate difference scores between the concrete and abstract means for ratings of the respondent’s power, abstract thinking, and willingness to make judgments. Following 
            Judd et al.’s (2001) recommendation, we also calculated sum scores for abstract thinking and willingness to make judgments by summing the concrete and abstract means, then centered these scores. Finally, we regressed the power difference score simultaneously on the difference scores for abstract thinking and willingness to make judgments, along with the centered sum scores for abstract thinking and willingness to make judgments. The difference scores for both abstract thinking (
            <em>b</em> = 0.27, 
            <em>SE</em> = .09, 
            <em>p</em> = .002) and willingness to make judgments (

            <em>SE</em> = .08, 
            <em>p</em> &lt; .001) were significant predictors. However, the intercept of the model was still significant (

            <em>SE</em> = .08, 
            <em>p</em> = .01), indicating that there remained differences in power ratings unaccounted for by ratings of abstract thinking and willingness to make judgments. Thus, we found evidence for partial within-subjects mediation by both abstract thinking and willingness to make judgments ratings of the relationship between language and ratings of power.

Use of abstract language that captured the gist or meaning of an event led a speaker to be perceived as more powerful, relative to concrete language that focused on specific details and actions, regardless of whether the speaker was discussing a person, a societal issue, or a product; describing something negative or positive; or saying a few words or several sentences. Although in some of the individual experiments there were independent effects of abstract language on judgments of warmth and competence, these were inconsistent and often moderated by valence. A persistent, unmoderated effect of abstract language was found only for judgments of power.

Our results are in line with, and therefore help to further bolster, a behavioral signal approach, which has suggested that behavioral patterns associated with particular positions or personality characteristics may serve as a cue to observers that an individual possesses that position or personality characteristic (e.g., 
          Hall, Coates, &amp; Smith LeBeau, 2005; 
          Magee, 2009; 
          Puts et al., 2006, 
          2007). Moreover, our findings point out that these associations can be relatively fluid; that is, a person may associate not only single behaviors (e.g., speaking with a lower pitched voice) but also styles of thinking or acting that imply a broad set of behaviors, with a given characteristic (e.g., power), and then make associated judgments regarding that characteristic based on the presence of one of those behaviors. In the current context, specifically, we expected that people associate power with abstract thinking and would therefore be sensitive to indicators of abstract thinking when making judgments about power. We focused on one critical area in which abstract thinking is likely to be especially evident to an observer—abstraction in linguistic communication—and found that this impacted power judgments. We expect that other indicators of abstract thinking (e.g., increased focus on goals and other defining aspects; broad, stereotypical thinking) would likewise have a similar impact.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Support for the centrality of abstraction per se to the current results emerges from several aspects of the findings we report. First, we operationalized abstract language in a variety of ways across the current studies, applying different existing frameworks for how language can be more concrete or abstract (e.g., 
          Semin &amp; Fielder’s, 1988, LCM; 
          Vallacher &amp; Wegner’s, 1987, action identification model) and supplementing these with additional manipulations informed by an understanding of abstraction as a process that captures the gist of a situation (
          Trope &amp; Liberman, 2010). Across these different manipulations, results provided converging evidence for a consistent, robust effect of abstract (vs. concrete) language on judgments of power. In addition, in Experiments 5 and 6, we measured perceptions of the speaker as an abstract thinker and found that this plays a mediational role in the link between abstract language and judgments of the speaker’s power. We also found in those experiments that perceptions of the speaker’s judgmentalness played a mediational role in this link, but results of some of our other experiments (i.e., Experiments 3 and 4) suggest that the exact role of judgmentalness may be dependent on the particular stimuli and context involved, as well as the type of judgmentalness studied (issues we discuss in more detail in a subsequent section of the General Discussion). Although future research may continue to unpack the role of perceived judgmentalness in perceptions of power, the current findings on the whole lend further support to a social distance approach to power (
          Magee &amp; Smith, 2013), which has conceptualized power as a form of social distance and argued for a causal impact of power on abstract thinking. The current findings suggest that, indeed, people are sensitive to this association and therefore will make power inferences from indicators of abstract thinking.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The current findings are also conceptually relevant to prior research that has begun to explore inferences perceivers make about speakers on the basis of their linguistic abstraction. Much of this work has been inspired by 
          Semin and Fiedler’s (1988) research on the LCM and has therefore particularly focused on differences in using adjectives versus verbs to describe others’ actions. 
          Douglas and Sutton (2006), for instance, found that observers judged a describer who used abstract (rather than concrete) positive descriptions as more likely to be a friend of the person (and less likely to be an enemy), more likely to hold a positive attitude toward the person, and more likely to be attempting to create a positive impression of the person. The converse was found for describers using abstract negative descriptions. Similarly, 
          Reitsma-van Rooijen, Semin, and van Leeuwen (2007) found that this dynamic influenced feelings of interpersonal connection to a describer who characterized one’s own behavior: Participants felt more connected to a describer who used abstract (vs. concrete) language to depict the participant’s positive behavior and less connected to a describer who used abstract (vs. concrete) language to depict the participant’s negative behavior. 
          Douglas and Sutton (2010) further expanded on this to suggest that linguistic abstraction influences overall judgments of a describer’s likability: As we replicated in the current studies, individuals find abstract describers of positive behaviors more likable and abstract describers of negative behaviors less likable. Supporting and expanding on this prior research, the current findings suggest that an even larger set of judgments may be influenced by communicators’ linguistic abstraction. Moreover, our findings demonstrate that (a) abstraction may lead to broad main effects on judgments of communicators’ personality characteristic that are not dependent on the communication’s valence (as in 
          Douglas &amp; Sutton, 2010) and (b) effects of abstraction on social inference are not limited to the types of contexts focused on by the LCM (use of verbs vs. adjectives) but rather extend more broadly to a variety of ways communication can be rendered more versus less abstract.
        </p><a id="psp-107-1-41-ECADA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The Role of Different Mediators in the Language/Perceptions-of-Power Effect</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In Experiment 5, we found that perceptions of the respondent as judgmental and as an abstract thinker were both significant mediators of the relationship between abstract language and perceptions of the respondent as powerful. Our measure of judgmentalness in that study was a set of items connoting the negative-tinged aspect of conferring judgment on another person—judgmental, arrogant, and the like. Because the stimuli used in Experiment 5 consisted of abstract and concrete descriptions of behaviors performed by another person, and a valenced item becomes more extremely valenced when described abstractly (
          Trope &amp; Liberman, 2010), abstract respondents were making more extreme positive and negative statements than concrete respondents, and these extremely valenced statements by abstract respondents implied judgments about other people. Thus, the type of negatively tinged judgmentalness items we used to measure this construct was especially appropriate to this context. However, when the single item “judgmentalness” was included in earlier studies (Studies 2, 3a, 3b, and 4), it only sometimes varied across linguistic abstraction condition.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">As we noted in our description of Experiment 6, however, judgmentalness does not necessarily need to be a negatively tinged characteristic. That is, the characteristic of being willing to make judgments and reach conclusions can be more neutral in nature, and this type of willingness to make judgments may be a broader potential mediator for effects of linguistic abstraction on power judgments. To explore this, we measured willingness to make judgments in Experiment 6 using more neutral terms, within the context of experimental stimuli that (a) described a product, rather than a person, and (b) were constructed to communicate highly similar content across linguistic abstraction condition. Results of Experiment 6 support mediation via such willingness to make judgments (as well as mediation via big-picture thinking), suggesting that judgmentalness thus broadly construed is an important driver of the effect of linguistic abstraction on power judgments.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Of course, big-picture thinking and willingness to make judgments are undoubtedly not exclusive mediators of this effect. For example, in real-world contexts, an additional potential mediator is that speaking abstractly makes people feel more powerful (cf. 
          Smith et al., 2008), thereby altering aspects of their nonverbal communication, which in turn affects the degree to which others see them as powerful. Although the current studies were not designed to explore this possibility, it would be interesting to do so in future research. More generally, this points to the possibility that other processes contribute to the current effects (indeed, results of Experiment 6 supported partial rather than complete mediation), and the important caveat that the exact role of potential mediators across different linguistic content and different contexts requires further clarification.
        </p><a id="psp-107-1-41-EBADA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Practical Implications and Future Directions</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Speaking in an abstract fashion is a relatively simple and, to some extent, a controllable action (e.g., 
          Douglas &amp; Sutton, 2003; 
          Douglas, Sutton, &amp; Wilkin, 2008), particularly when communication is written or a speech is prepared in full beforehand, as in many political contexts; that this serves as a meaningful power signal has intriguing implications for political and business contexts in which managing perceptions of one’s power is especially important. Rather than focusing just on speaking to the right kind of people, or covering the right topics, we suggest it is important to think about the words one uses. Speakers may sometimes choose to discuss issues in very concrete terms, perhaps to show off their knowledge of a particular domain. Such concreteness may or may not be taken as a sign of the speakers’ competence, given the mixed results we found across stimuli in our experiments, but it is highly likely to lead them to be seen as less powerful and thus as having less leadership potential. Indeed, our findings are consistent with the negative connotations in the political domain, for those who aspire to powerful positions, of being labeled a “policy wonk.”
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The use of abstract language may be a particularly effective power signal because of its subtlety. Though the achievement of power may be associated with a variety of positive outcomes (e.g., 
          Anderson &amp; Berdahl, 2002; 
          Galinsky et al., 2003; 
          Marmot et al., 1991; 
          Sherman et al., 2012), the overt pursuit of power is often not viewed positively (e.g., 
          Hays, 2013). For example, women may be particularly concerned about reporting an interest in powerful roles because power is more socially desirable for men than for women (e.g., 
          Rudman &amp; Glick, 1999). Because perceivers may not notice small changes in linguistic abstraction made by a communicator, and are even less likely to label such changes as “power plays,” linguistic abstraction may be a relatively safe way to pursue power covertly.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Intriguingly, one primary aspect of abstraction, in language and other forms, is that it captures features that tend to be invariant over time (
          Trope &amp; Liberman, 2010). Thus, invariance in communication—for example, keeping a strong and consistent stance on matters even when they call for frequent revision—may, due to its relationship to abstraction, serve as a power signal. A particularly telling example is the 2004 U.S. presidential election, in which John Kerry was branded as a “flip-flopper” in an ad supporting George W. Bush. The overriding sentiment was that a lack of consistency was a negative trait for a leader. This dovetails well with our current findings that concrete communication, which tends to be more variant and context specific, acts as a low-power signal.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">However, an important caveat to the above conclusions is that in all cases, we measured in the current studies immediate reactions to short snippets of language. Although such short snippets of language are sometimes all that is communicated (as when, for example, a single quotation ends up in a news story or a public relations bulletin), most communications are significantly longer and more varied. It would not be surprising if the effects we explore here did not directly transfer to lengthier speech. For example, powerful people who only speak in abstract terms and are never able to communicate concrete, detailed information may ultimately come to be seen as surface-oriented or lacking depth. Future research may therefore explore the longevity of the current effects, both in terms of continued impact and in terms of whether abstraction will have a less positive impact on power judgments if it is never supplemented with concrete information. This point is especially relevant given that the current experiments cumulatively suggest that use of abstract language consistently increases perceptions of a target’s power, but not judgments of his or her competence. People seen as powerful but not especially competent may risk having their power be seen as illegitimate by others, which may lead to downstream negative consequences (e.g., 
          Fast &amp; Chen, 2009). Supplementing abstract statements with concrete detail to convey knowledge of the issue at hand, or otherwise ensuring that abstract statements are accompanied by signals of competence (e.g., mentioning one’s extensive prior experience with a situation), may therefore be a useful strategy for being perceived as a legitimate power-holder.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">It may also be interesting to explore order effects when communication contains both abstract and concrete communication. It seems plausible that power judgments will be impacted by whether someone begins with abstract communication and becomes more concrete, as opposed to starting with concrete communication and becoming more abstract. The former approach may be more effective by establishing power first, with the concrete communication then suggesting that the abstract communicator is also knowledgeable.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Relatedly, it is important to consider situations in which abstract language would not be seen as a sign of power. In the current experiments, the speakers were either supposedly supplied with all the information they needed to write about (Experiments 1–2, 4–6) or our participants could easily assume that the speakers had sufficient knowledge of the topic at hand (Experiments 3a–3b). Thus, the use of abstract language reflected the ability to extract a deeper point or the bigger picture from all the relevant information. In situations in which it is not clear the speaker has all the relevant information, in contrast, it is plausible that abstract language will be seen as too general or vague. For example, imagine an audience believes that a speaker does not know much about possible budget cuts at a company. If the speaker uses more abstract language when describing the cuts, such language may be seen as too vague and indirect and thus a sign of weakness, as compared with using more concrete language. However, abstract language may still be seen as fitting what one would expect from someone in a high-power position within that context, and it is therefore not clear what impact abstract language would have on power judgments in that situation. Future research should explore this and other potential boundary conditions related to the larger context within which the communication is occurring (e.g., whether it is an affectively neutral time period or the communication happens during a crisis situation).</p><a id="psp-107-1-41-EAADA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Conclusion</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Although we focus on immediate reactions to short communications, we believe that such immediate impressions can be quite impactful, and short exposures are often people’s only exposure to power-holders and -seekers. Overall, our research suggests that in such situations, those wanting to seem powerful should resist the temptation to demonstrate their depth of knowledge by providing elaborate, concrete detail when communicating, and instead use more abstract language that emphasizes a topic’s gist and goes beyond concrete depiction. Because any type of information can be communicated at different levels of abstraction, this suggestion provides practical advice that may be implemented broadly. Those interested in being perceived as more powerful may therefore be well served to talk in terms of the forest rather than the individual trees.</p><a id="psp-107-1-41-R" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_128" title="Footnotes">Footnotes</a></span><a id="fn1" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><sup>1</sup> An additional item (convey less meaning vs. convey more meaning) was not included because it had a negative item-total correlation and brought down alpha considerably.</p><a id="fn2" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><sup>2</sup> Including nonnative English speakers and people who failed attention checks did not appreciably change the results in this or any other experiment.</p><a id="fn3" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><sup>3</sup> Pictures were taken from Google images but inspired by materials generously shared by Karen Douglas and used in

With negative behaviors, the indirect effect through judgmentalness is significantly stronger than the indirect effect through abstract thinking; with positive behaviors, these two paths are of roughly equal strength.

Specifically, we calculated difference scores (e.g., ratings of abstract politicians minus ratings of concrete politicians) separately for ratings of warmth and competence and included these new variables as covariates with the original analysis of ratings of power. The main effect of level of abstraction on ratings of power remained significant or marginally significant in three of the four experiments for which we were able to do these analyses.
