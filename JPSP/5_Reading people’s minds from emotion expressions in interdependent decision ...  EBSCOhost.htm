The ability to infer others’ beliefs, desires, and intentions from their facial expressions should be especially important in interdependent decision making when people make decisions from beliefs about the others’ intention to cooperate. Five experiments tested the general proposition that people follow principles of appraisal when making inferences from emotion displays, in context. Experiment 1 revealed that the same emotion display produced opposite effects depending on context: When the other was competitive, a smile on the other’s face evoked a more negative response than when the other was cooperative. Experiment 2 revealed that the essential information from emotion displays was derived from appraisals (e.g., Is the current state of affairs conducive to my goals? Who is to blame for it?); facial displays of emotion had the same impact on people’s decision making as textual expressions of the corresponding appraisals. Experiments 3, 4, and 5 used multiple mediation analyses and a causal-chain design: Results supported the proposition that beliefs about others’ appraisals mediate the effects of emotion displays on expectations about others’ intentions. We suggest a model based on appraisal theories of emotion that posits an inferential mechanism whereby people retrieve, from emotion expressions, information about others’ appraisals, which then lead to inferences about others’ mental states. This work has implications for the design of algorithms that drive agent behavior in human–agent strategic interaction, an emerging domain at the interface of computer science and social psychology.

        Sodian &amp; Kristen, 2010). Nonverbal displays, notably facial expression of emotion, may contain critical cues for making inferences about other’s mental states (
        Boone &amp; Buck, 2003; 
        Frank, 2004; 
        Frijda &amp; Mesquita, 1994; 
        Keltner &amp; Haidt, 1999; 
        Keltner &amp; Kring, 1998; 
        Morris &amp; Keltner, 2000; 
        Nesse, 1990; 
        Parkinson &amp; Simons, 2009; 
        Trivers, 1971). In line with this, in interdependent decision making—mixed-motive interaction where outcomes depend on decisions made by self and other (
        Pruitt &amp; Kimmel, 1977)—emotion displays can impact negotiation (e.g., 
        van Kleef, De Dreu, &amp; Manstead, 2004, 
        2006), trust (e.g., 
        Krumhuber et al., 2007), reactions to ultimatums (e.g., 
        van Dijk, Van Kleef, Steinel, &amp; Van Beest, 2008), cooperation in public goods dilemmas (e.g., 
        Wubben, De Cremer, &amp; van Dijk, 2009), and dispute resolution (
        Friedman et al., 2004). The mechanisms underlying such interpersonal effects of emotion have not been fully uncovered, and this leads us to ask: What information do people retrieve from emotion displays?
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">This question was also raised by 
        Van Kleef, De Dreu, and Manstead (2010), and the answer, they suggested, was that “each discrete emotion has its own antecedents, appraisal components, relational themes, and action tendencies” (p. 48); thus, “observing a particular emotion in another person provides relatively differentiated information about how that person regards the situation” (p. 53). We posit, and test in five experiments reported here, that this differentiated information can be understood under the concise framework of appraisal theories. According to appraisal theories (
        Frijda, 1989; 
        Ortony, Clore, &amp; Collins, 1988; 
        Roseman, 2001; 
        Scherer, 2001; 
        Smith &amp; Ellsworth, 1985; for a review, see Ellsworth &amp; Scherer, 2003), emotion displays arise from cognitive appraisal of events with respect to an agent’s goals, desires, and beliefs (e.g., Is this event congruent with my goals? Who is responsible for this event?). According to the pattern of appraisals that occurs, different emotions are experienced and displayed. Thus, a specific event does not define by itself which emotion an individual should experience; it is the appraisal of the situation with respect to the individual’s goals that defines which emotion will be experienced. Now, because displays reflect one’s intentions through the appraisal process, it is plausible to ask whether people can infer from emotion displays the others’ goals by reversing the appraisal mechanism. The intuition is that if appraisal, abstractly, is a function that maps from &lt; event, mental state &gt; to emotion, reverse appraisal is a function that maps from &lt; event, emotion &gt; to mental state (see 
        Figure 1).

Appraisal theory and reverse appraisal." /><em>Figure 1. Appraisal theory and reverse appraisal.</em></span></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">According to reverse appraisal, thus, people retrieve from emotion displays how others are appraising the ongoing interaction, and this information, in turn, leads to inferences about others’ intentions. In this sense, 
        Scherer and Grandjean (2008) showed that people are able to retrieve information about others’ appraisals from photos of facial expression of emotion; however, their study did not show that this information could lead to inferences about others’ mental states, in particular, others’ intentions in an interdependent decision-making context. 
        Hareli and Hess (2010) showed that people can, from expressed emotion, make inferences about the character of the person displaying emotion and that these inferences were mediated by perceived appraisals. For instance, a person who reacted with anger to blame was perceived as more aggressive and self-confident than a person who reacted with sadness. Hareli and Hess focused on how emotion expressions lead to inferences about people’s personalities; here, we are interested in how emotion expressions lead to inferences about people’s intentions in interdependent decision making.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Reverse appraisal can be viewed as an inferential mechanism for the social effects of emotion in decision making. According to this inferential pathway perspective, emotions communicate information that helps disambiguate the beliefs, desires, and intentions of one’s counterpart in a decision-making setting (
        Van Kleef et al., 2010). For instance, 
        van Kleef et al. (2004) have shown that people negotiating with angry counterparts tend to concede because they infer the counterparts to have high aspirations. According to reverse appraisal, such inferences about the counterpart’s mental states, in this case, aspirations, are achieved via perceptions of how the counterpart is appraising the ongoing interaction. The claim is, thus, that a critical piece of information people retrieve from emotion expressions is about appraisals, and this information, in turn, leads to inferences about others’ mental states.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The reverse appraisal pathway can be contrasted to the affective pathway (
        Parkinson &amp; Simons, 2009; 
        Van Kleef et al., 2010), where others’ emotional expressions directly elicit emotion in observers, and these affective reactions, then, influence decision making. The prototypical example of an affective process is emotional contagion or mimicry (
        Hatfield, Cacioppo, &amp; Rapson, 1994; 
        Niedenthal, Mermillod, Maringer, &amp; Hess, 2010), which is said to occur due to people’s natural tendency to automatically mimic and synchronize with others’ facial expressions, vocalizations, and postures; afferent feedback from mimicked behavior, then, leads to the experience of similar emotions. After catching others’ emotions, people’s decisions might be influenced, for instance, by (mis)attributing the current affective state to the current context (i.e., the affect-as-information heuristic; 
        Schwarz &amp; Clore, 1983; cf. 
        Carnevale, 2008). Reverse appraisal, thus, does not explain or substitute the affective pathway; there are situations in which these mechanisms might co-occur and, perhaps, interfere with each other.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">A third pathway, which is related to but different than the affective pathway, is social appraisal (
        Manstead &amp; Fischer, 2001). This perspective also concerns the impact of others’ emotional expressions on one’s own emotions. Social appraisal posits that other’s emotions impact one’s own appraisals of the situation, which, only then, elicit emotion. For instance, 
        Fischer, Rotteveel, Evers, and Manstead (2004) found that participants’ reacted more angrily to a poor grade given by an instructor when other students reacted with anger but more sadly when others reacted with sadness. Social appraisal acknowledges that other people can be the object of “regular” appraisals (e.g., regarding blameworthiness), but the point is that specific “social” appraisals occur because people care about how others react to situations. Both mechanisms claim people can retrieve appraisals from emotion displays, but social appraisal is distinct from reverse appraisal in, at least, two ways: First, social appraisal places the emphasis on own appraisals, whereas reverse appraisal emphasizes others’ appraisals; second, social appraisal focuses on how others’ emotional expressions lead to own emotions (via the impact of others’ appraisals on own appraisals), whereas reverse appraisal focuses on how others’ emotional expressions lead to inferences about others’ mental states (i.e., theory of mind).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The five experiments reported in this article test the plausibility of reverse appraisal as an inferential mechanism for the social effects of emotion expression in decision making. The experiments reflect a causal model derived from reverse appraisal whereby people retrieve information from emotion expressions about how others appraise the interaction, and this information, in turn, leads to inferences about others’ mental states. To test this model, we had participants engage in interdependent decision making in the prisoner’s dilemma game, with emotional counterparts. Each experiment tested a specific prediction of reverse appraisal. Experiment 1 tested the prediction that what is critical for the social effects of emotion is the underlying information rather than the displays themselves. We tested whether the same displays could achieve opposite effects on emergence of cooperation in the prisoner’s dilemma depending on the context in which they were shown. Experiment 2 tested the prediction that emotion displays achieve the same function as information about others’ appraisals. We tested whether we could achieve the same effects on expectations of cooperation with facial displays of emotion as with corresponding textual expressions of appraisals. Experiments 3 and 4 tested the prediction, through multiple mediation analyses (
        Preacher &amp; Hayes, 2008), that perception of others’ appraisals mediate the social effects of emotion displays on, respectively, people’s decision making and expectations about others’ mental states. Finally, Experiment 5 presents complementary evidence, following a causal-chain design (
        Spencer, Zanna, &amp; Fong, 2005), for the mediating role of perception of appraisals.
      </p><a id="psp-106-1-73-EFDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_12" title="Experiment 1">Experiment 1</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Our model of reverse appraisal posits that the information people retrieve from emotion displays pertains to information about appraisals. For instance, from a display of joy, people infer that counterparts find the current state of affairs to be conducive to their goals (e.g., 
        Ortony et al., 1988). Thus, the same display of joy is likely to lead to different reactions if it is shown in a competitive as opposed to a cooperative context. This experiment, therefore, tests whether the same emotion displays can have different, or even opposing, effects on people’s decision making. To accomplish this, we had people engage in the iterated prisoner’s dilemma with counterparts that, despite following the same strategy to choose their actions, showed displays that were compatible with either a cooperative or competitive goal orientation. The 
        <em>expressively cooperative</em> counterpart expressed joy when mutual cooperation occurred, regret when it exploited the participant, and nothing otherwise. The 
        <em>expressively competitive</em> counterpart expressed joy when it exploited the participant, regret when mutual cooperation occurred, and nothing otherwise. Our hypothesis was:

        
<br /><em>Hypothesis 1:</em> People cooperate more with an expressively cooperative counterpart than with an expressively competitive counterpart.

            Table 1. The task represents a dilemma because the rational (i.e., utility-maximizing) choice for both players is to defect, which results in an outcome (mutual defection) that is worse than mutual cooperation. The form and labels of the task used here came from 
            Kiesler, Waters, and Sproull (1996). Participants were told there would be no communication between the players before choosing an action and that the other player would make a decision without knowledge of the participant’s choice. After the round was over, the action each chose was made available to both players, and the outcome of the round (i.e., the number of points each player got) was shown. Each participant played this task for 25 rounds. A tutorial was also presented to the participants before starting the task.

            Blascovich &amp; McCall, 2013). Moreover, virtual agents have been argued to be an appropriate tool for research in social psychology (

            Figure 2 shows the agent and the corresponding facial displays. These facial displays were animated using a muscular model of the face that replicates prototypical emotional expressions (

          Hareli &amp; Hess, 2010; 
          Lanzetta &amp; Englis, 1989; 
          Van Kleef et al., 2010) and are in line with reverse appraisal’s prediction that the underlying information, not the displays themselves, is especially important for social effects of emotion expressions. Experiment 2 was designed to directly address the nature of information that people retrieve from others’ emotion displays.

To achieve this, we compared the social effects of facial displays of emotions with the social effects of textual expression of the corresponding appraisals. Appraisal theorists (
        Frijda, 1989; 
        Ortony et al., 1988; 
        Roseman, 2001; 
        Scherer, 2001; 
        Smith &amp; Ellsworth, 1985) tend to agree that goal conduciveness and blameworthiness are key appraisals for eliciting joy and regret: Joy is elicited if the event is appraised to be goal conducive, and regret is elicited if the event is appraised to be goal obstructive and the self is to blame. Appraisal theories thus suggest a systematic way of mapping emotion displays into textual expressions of appraisals. Accordingly, we mapped joy to “I like this outcome” and regret to “I do not like this outcome and I blame myself for it.” The experiment itself consisted of scenarios in which participants imagined engaging in the prisoner’s dilemma with an emotional counterpart. Participants were told a certain outcome of the dilemma occurred and then watched a video of the counterpart’s reaction. This reaction consisted of a facial display of emotion, textual expression of appraisals, both, or none. We then measured people’s expectation of how likely the counterpart was to cooperate in the future. Expectations of cooperation have been shown in the past to be correlated with people’s decision to cooperate (
        Balliet &amp; Van Lange, 2012). Following the previous experiment, we explored (facial and appraisal) expressions of joy and regret in the context of mutual cooperation and when the counterpart exploits the participant. For each pairing of emotion and outcome, we hypothesized a significant interaction between facial display and textual appraisals on expectations of cooperation:

        
<br /><em>Hypothesis 2a:</em> Following mutual cooperation, people expect more cooperation when a counterpart expresses joy through facial displays, textual appraisals, or both, compared with no expression.
          
<br /><em>Hypothesis 2b:</em> Following mutual cooperation, people expect less cooperation when a counterpart expresses regret through facial displays, textual appraisals, or both, compared with no expression.
          
<br /><em>Hypothesis 2c:</em> Following exploitation by a counterpart, people expect less cooperation when the counterpart expresses joy through facial displays, textual appraisals, or both, compared with no expression.
          
<br /><em>Hypothesis 2d:</em> Following exploitation by a counterpart, people expect more cooperation when the counterpart expresses regret through facial displays, textual appraisals, or both, compared with no expression.

Thus, the proposed mediators were the perception of appraisals measures: goal conduciveness (averaged), self-blame (Question 5), and participant blame (Question 6).

          Table 4. For instance, following mutual cooperation, the point estimate for the total indirect effect of joy on people’s decision to cooperate was .240, and this was significantly different than zero (because the corresponding bias-corrected 95% confidence interval did not contain zero); moreover, the specific indirect effect through goal conduciveness was significant and equal to .256. The remaining indirect effects for self- and participant blame were not significant. This means that goal conduciveness mediated the effect of joy, following mutual cooperation, on people’s decision to cooperate. Overall, the results showed that the effects of joy and regret, following mutual cooperation, were mediated by perceptions of goal conduciveness; and, the effect of regret, after the counterpart exploits, was mediated by perceptions of self-blame.

          Preacher &amp; Hayes, 2008) of perceptions of appraisal on the effect of emotion displays on expectations of cooperation. We ran a separate analysis for each combination of display and outcome. The independent variable was the expressed emotion, which was binary coded: 0, for the neutral display; 1, for the display of joy, sadness, anger, or regret. The proposed mediators were the perception of appraisal variables: goal conduciveness, self-blame, and participant blame. The dependent variable was expectations of cooperation. 
          Table 5 shows the results. For instance, following the case in which the participant exploits, the point estimate for the total indirect effect of anger on people’s expectations of cooperation was −.839, and this was significantly different than zero (because the corresponding bias-corrected 95% confidence interval did not contain zero); moreover, the specific indirect effect through goal conduciveness tended to be significant (because the corresponding bias-corrected 90% confidence interval did not contain zero) and equal to −.278, and the specific indirect effect through participant blame was significant and equal to −.564. The remaining indirect effect for self-blame was not significant. This means that goal conduciveness and participant blame mediated the effect of anger, after the participant exploits, on people’s expectations of cooperation. In sum, the results showed that in mutual cooperation, perceptions of goal conduciveness mediated the effects of joy, sadness, anger, and regret; in mutual defection, perceptions of self-blame mediated the effects of anger and regret; when the counterpart exploits, goal conduciveness mediated the effect of joy, all appraisals mediated the effect of sadness, goal conduciveness and participant blame mediated the effect of anger, and goal conduciveness and self-blame mediated the effect of regret. Finally, when the participant exploits, participant blame mediated the effect of sadness, goal conduciveness and participant blame mediated the effect of anger, and self- and participant blame mediated the effect of regret.

          Scherer and Grandjean’s (2008) findings, the results showed that people were able to retrieve others’ appraisals from emotion displays: a smile meant the counterpart found the outcome goal conducive; sadness meant the counterpart found the outcome goal obstructive; anger meant the counterpart found the outcome goal obstructive and blamed the participant for it; finally, regret meant the counterpart found the outcome goal obstructive and blamed itself for it. Overall, these patterns matched expectations from appraisal theories (
          Ellsworth &amp; Scherer, 2003). The results also showed that facial displays of joy, sadness, anger, and regret impacted people’s expectations of cooperation. The effects for joy and regret replicated the findings in the previous experiments. For instance, joy after mutual cooperation increased expectations of cooperation, whereas joy after the counterpart exploited the participant did not significantly differ from the neutral display. The results for sadness and anger were also mostly compatible with the existing literature (e.g., 
          Van Kleef et al., 2010). For instance, anger in mutual cooperation reduced expectations of cooperation, whereas sadness after the counterpart exploited increased expectations of cooperation. Finally, the results showed that perceptions of appraisals (partially and, at times, fully) mediated the effects of emotion displays on expectations of cooperation, thus showing partial support for Hypothesis 4. The next experiment builds on this and presents complementary evidence for the mediating role of perception of appraisals.

        Baron &amp; Kenny, 1986; 
        Preacher &amp; Hayes, 2008) is no substitute to showing mediation experimentally. As an alternative to the statistical approach, they propose the experimental-causal-chain design, in which each link of the proposed causal model is shown experimentally. Applying this technique here means showing, experimentally, each of the causal links in the proposed causal model in which emotion expressions cause perceptions of appraisals (Link i), which then cause inferences about expectations of cooperation (Link ii). The effect of emotion displays on perception of appraisals (Link i) was shown in Experiment 4. In turn, Experiment 5 focused on Link ii and tested, experimentally, whether explicitly communicating appraisals can impact expectations of cooperation in the same way the corresponding facial expressions did in Experiment 4. To accomplish this, perceptions of appraisals were, as in Experiment 2, explicitly manipulated by having the counterpart, instead of displaying emotion through the face, express the appraisals directly through text. In line with reverse appraisal’s prediction that perception of appraisals mediate the effects of emotion on expectations about others’ mental states (i.e., Hypothesis 4), we expected textual appraisals to lead to similar effects on expectations of cooperation as found with facial displays in Experiment 4.

The manipulation consisted, instead, of emotion displays, of textual expression of the appraisals. Following appraisal theories (
          Ellsworth &amp; Scherer, 2003), joy was mapped to “I like this outcome,” sadness to “I do not like this outcome,” anger to “I do not like this outcome and I blame you for it,”regret to “I do not like this outcome and I blame myself for it,” and the neutral display to “I do not like, nor dislike this outcome.” As before, participants were introduced to the counterpart they imagined interacting with; however, only a static image was shown of the (neutral) face. The textual expression of appraisals was simulated by typing at the bottom of the screen, as if simulating a chat interface. After watching the video of the counterpart’s reaction, we asked participants questions about perception of appraisals and expectations of cooperation as in the previous experiment.

The results, thus, supported that the manipulation was successful.

The trend for a three-way Sample × Outcome × Emotion Display/Textual Appraisals interaction might have occurred due to subtle differences in the effects of textual appraisals, relative to the emotion displays, in the participant exploits conditions. Understanding these subtleties in the correspondence of effects of emotion displays and textual appraisals may be an interesting line of future work. Overall, according to 
          Spencer et al. (2005), because Experiment 4 showed that facial displays impacted perceptions of the counterpart’s appraisals and Experiment 5 showed that perception of appraisals led to corresponding inferences about the counterpart’s cooperation, there is, in further support of Hypothesis 4, experimental evidence that perception of appraisals mediate the effects of emotion expressions on expectations about others’ mental states.

Furthermore, Experiments 3 and 4 showed, using multiple mediation analyses (
        Preacher &amp; Hayes, 2008), that these perceptions of others’ appraisals mediated the effects of emotion expressions on, respectively, people’s decision making and on expectations about others’ mental states. Finally, Experiment 5 presented complementary evidence, using a causal-chain design (
        Spencer et al., 2005), for the mediating role of appraisals.
      </p><a id="psp-106-1-73-EBADA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Implications</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Our findings are compatible with the view that emotion expressions serve the important social function of communicating information about one’s beliefs, desires, and intentions (
          Frank, 2004; 
          Frijda &amp; Mesquita, 1994; 
          Keltner &amp; Haidt, 1999; 
          Keltner &amp; Kring, 1998; 
          Morris &amp; Keltner, 2000; 
          Van Kleef et al., 2010), and, specifically, information about one’s propensity for cooperation in interdependent decision making, in particular social dilemmas (
          Boone &amp; Buck, 2003; 
          Frank, 2004; 
          Nesse, 1990; 
          Trivers, 1971). Our results, furthermore, propose reverse appraisal as the mechanism by which such inferences regarding others’ mental states are achieved. Accordingly, people retrieve, from emotion expressions, information about how others are appraising the ongoing interaction, and, in turn, this information leads to inferences about others’ intentions.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The experiments reported here support the view that perceptions of appraisals mediate the effects of emotion displays on people’s expectations about others’ intentions (Experiments 4 and 5) and people’s actual decisions (Experiment 3). These results are compatible with prior research that suggests expectations of others’ behavior correlate positively with actual cooperation in social dilemmas (e.g., 
          Balliet &amp; Van Lange, 2012) and, further, support causality. Because, for many pairings of emotion with outcome, appraisals fully mediated the effects of emotion expressions, we can exclude alternative explanations such as affective processes—which imply own emotion mediates the effect of emotion expressions on decision making (
          Parkinson &amp; Simons, 2009; 
          Van Kleef et al., 2010)—and social appraisal—which imply own appraisals mediate the social effects of emotion (
          Manstead &amp; Fischer, 2001; 
          Parkinson &amp; Simons, 2009).
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">More generally, our results speak to the role expressions play in shaping cooperation and competition. For example, our results contrast with research that suggests that genuine smiles are an unequivocal signal of cooperation (
          Brown, Palameta, &amp; Moore, 2003; 
          Mehu, Grammer, &amp; Dunbar, 2007; 
          Scharlemann, Eckel, Kacelnik, &amp; Wilson, 2001) and are in line with research that argues a smile can have different interpretations according to context (
          Aviezer et al., 2008; 
          Hareli &amp; Hess, 2010; 
          Lanzetta &amp; Englis, 1989; 
          Van Kleef et al., 2010). Effectively, our results showed that in a cooperative context, such as following mutual cooperation, a smile led to expectations of cooperation; in a noncooperative context, such as following mutual defection (Experiment 4), a smile decreased expectations of cooperation; yet in another context, such as following the case in which the counterpart exploits the participant, a smile seemed to have signaled redundant information to that communicated by the counterpart’s behavior and, thus, did not affect expectations of cooperation (which were low, similarly to the case for the neutral display).
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The results on the expression of joy are striking: In the context of mutual cooperation, joy either from the face or from text reinforced expectations of cooperation (see 
          Figure 3a) but joy had no impact on expectations of cooperation under conditions of exploitation. One might expect that joy expressed by the other when the other exploited (possibly a form of Schadenfreude) might decrease expectations of cooperation, but it did not (see 
          Figure 3c). There are several possibilities that could explain this: it could be that there is a floor effect and that a better measurement procedure might show an effect (a level of 3 on the scale was about as low as participants went). Or, it could be simply that this behavior (exploitation in the prisoner’s dilemma) is so salient that evidence of the other’s Schadenfreude was simply ignored. Or, it could be that the other was simply assumed to be joyful at having exploited and done so well at one’s own expense, and seeing evidence of their reaction did not add to the low view of it. Regardless, it is a potentially interesting avenue for further work.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The results also show that negative emotions can be important to identify cooperators (
          Chapman, Kim, Susskind, &amp; Anderson, 2009) and support the general contention that people use both positive and negative emotion displays to identify and punish noncooperators (
          Boone &amp; Buck, 2003; 
          Schug, Matsumoto, Horita, Yamagishi, &amp; Bonnet, 2010). Finally, despite not presenting specific predictions for the prisoner’s dilemma, 
          Van Kleef et al. (2010) advance general predictions for cooperative behavior according to whether a given situation is perceived as cooperative or competitive. Our results suggest that the combination of outcome with emotion display in the prisoner’s dilemma can, indeed, impact the perception of how cooperative the situation is. For instance, in line with their predictions for cooperative situations, expression of joy in mutual cooperation or regret when the counterpart exploits the participant led to expectations of cooperation; in line with their predictions for competitive situations, the expression of anger in mutual cooperation tended to lead to noncooperation.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Our findings also have implications for the rationality of human social behavior. Findings such as in Experiment 1, where people depart from game-theoretic predictions of noncooperation, are often interpreted as either failures of human decision making or failures of rational models (e.g., 
          Frank, 2004). However, from a certain perspective, our participants are acting rationally: they observed information about the other party’s intentions, they judged the consistency of this information with past behavior, and decided how best to act. Traditional rational analysis of situations like the prisoner’s dilemma make strong assumptions about the information available to each party, including the inability of parties to communicate. More recent decision-theoretic frameworks, however, relax this strict assumption and highlight the rationality of basing decisions on evidence concerning the beliefs and intentions of the other party (e.g., 
          Battiggalli &amp; Dufwenberg, 2009), including “cheap” talk. In this sense, our results are consistent with the view that people are acting as rational decision makers and that any analysis of rationality must encompass the informational role of emotional signals.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We also explored in the present article only a subset of the appraisal variables suggested by appraisal theorists; aside from goal conduciveness and blameworthiness, other appraisals have been proposed, such as certainty, urgency, coping potential, and social norm compatibility (
          Ellsworth &amp; Scherer, 2003). Not considering some of these appraisal variables might explain why in Experiment 4, for some combinations of emotion and outcome, there was only partial mediation of perception of appraisals on the effects of emotion displays; the missing appraisals could represent some of the information people retrieve from emotion displays that the experiments failed to measure. Moving forward, these appraisals should be relevant for studying the social effects of other emotions (e.g., certainty, expectations, or probability of occurrence are pertinent for displays of fear or hope) and for distinguishing variations of the emotions studied here (e.g., social appraisals allow us to consider guilt as a form of regret related to the transgression of a social norm; 
          Baumeister, Stillwell, &amp; Heatherton, 1994).
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We argue in the present article reverse appraisal is an inferential mechanism for the interpersonal effects of emotion expressions in decision making. Indeed, our mediation results suggest that inferences (about appraisals and other’s intentions) play a central role explaining the social effects of emotions, at least in the context of the prisoner’s dilemma. However, other researchers have argued affective processes. and social appraisal can also play a role in explaining interpersonal effects of emotions (e.g., 
          Carnevale, 2008; 
          Carnevale &amp; Isen, 1986; 
          Parkinson &amp; Simons, 2009; 
          Van Kleef et al., 2010). Our results do not exclude the possibility that these alternative processes might co-occur with reverse appraisal, first, for pairings of emotion and outcome in the prisoner’s dilemma in which appraisals did not fully mediate the effects of emotion expressions and, second and most importantly, in different decision-making tasks. In fact, we expect situational context to influence how significant the role of each process is, as has been suggested before (
          Parkinson &amp; Simons, 2009; 
          Van Kleef et al., 2010). In the present research, participants presumably had a clear understanding of the prisoner’s dilemma and of the implications of a given outcome for their goal of maximizing their own points. One could argue that under these conditions, the primary usefulness of the other player’s emotional expressions would be to draw inferences about the player’s likely move in the next round of the prisoner’s dilemma, and that reverse appraisal provides an efficient way to make those inferences. Under other conditions (e.g., shared social identity with a player who is part of one’s team rather than an opponent), one could imagine that affective processes might shape responses to his or her facial expressions and that under still other conditions (e.g., a more ambiguous setting in which the two players are jointly confronted with challenges), one could imagine that social appraisal processes might shape the way in which participants react to others’ facial expressions. In other words, the setup used in the present research might have particularly lent itself to the reverse appraisal process. Thus, when studying other decision settings, it is important in the future to measure, aside from others’ appraisals, own appraisals and own emotions so that it may be possible to identify the mediators (and the causal order) for the social effects of emotions on people’s decision making. These mediation analyses could then be used to tease apart the contributions of reverse appraisal, affective processes, and social appraisal.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Regarding external validity, we have shown that reverse appraisal is useful in understanding the social effects of emotions in a Western student population (Experiments 1 and 3) as well as in a broader, more diversified online sample (Experiments 2, 4, and 5). However, it is also important to study reverse appraisal in the context of other decision-making tasks. Even though we used the prisoner’s dilemma in the present work, there is no reason not to expect reverse appraisal to be relevant in other social decision-making contexts such as other two- or N-person dilemma tasks or negotiation. 
          Carnevale and Pruitt (1992) called for this sort of generalization inquiry across mixed-motive tasks, and this represents a promising line of future inquiry.
        </p><a id="psp-106-1-73-EAADA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Coda</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The studies reported here serve as an important bridge between psychological findings on emotion and research in the fields of artificial intelligence and human–computer interaction. Increasingly, the computational sciences are seeking to develop algorithms that collaborate and sometimes compete with people in social tasks. For example, an active body of research seeks to develop algorithms that negotiate with or on behalf of human users (e.g., 
          Lin &amp; Kraus, 2010). Other research aims to improve the ability of computers to interact in such social tasks by both recognizing human emotional displays (e.g., 
          Calvo &amp; D’Mello, 2010; 
          Zeng, Pantic, Roisman, &amp; Huang, 2009) and even endowing computers and robots with anthropomorphic characteristics such as the ability to signal emotion (e.g., 
          DeSteno et al., 2012).
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">It is beyond the scope of this article to motivate the value of this enterprise (but see 
          Marsella, Gratch, &amp; Petta, 2010); however, our results make important contributions for how to design such systems. For example, Experiments 1 and 4 illustrate that a computer can shape cooperation rates through judicious display of emotion and, more generally, illustrate that appraisal theory serves as a concrete mathematical framework for translating the beliefs, desires, and intentions of machines into intuitive human-readable signals. The results also suggest possible approaches for allowing machines to interpret human emotional displays. Although we only looked at how people decode emotional signals and not how they produce them, it is worth exploring whether machines should incorporate some mechanism akin to reverse appraisal. For example, if a person smiles as a result of one of the machine’s actions, the machine would do well not simply to view the smile as a reward, but to reconstruct, using context, the underlying mental state that the smile presumably signifies. More generally, these findings highlight that emotions play a function role in social interactions (i.e., communicating mental state) and that computational systems can draw on this function to enhance their own efficacy.
