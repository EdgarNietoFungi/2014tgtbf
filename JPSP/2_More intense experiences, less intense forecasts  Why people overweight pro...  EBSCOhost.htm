The experience of an outcome (e.g., winning a gamble) is typically more affectively intense than the simulation of that outcome (e.g., imagining winning a gamble) upon which the affective forecast for it is based. We suggest that, as a result, experiencers allocate a larger share of their attention toward the outcome (e.g., winning the gamble) and less to its probability specifications than do affective forecasters. Consequently, hedonic responses to an outcome are less sensitive to its probability specifications than are affective forecasts for that outcome. The results of 6 experiments provide support for our theory. Affective forecasters overestimated how sensitive experiencers would be to the probability of positive and negative outcomes (Experiments 1 and 2). Consistent with our attentional account, differences in sensitivity to probability specifications disappeared when the attention of forecasters was diverted from probability specifications (Experiment 3) or when the attention of experiencers was drawn toward probability specifications (Experiment 4). Finally, differences in sensitivity to probability specifications between forecasters and experiencers were diminished when the forecasted outcome was more affectively intense (Experiments 5 and 6).

        Loewenstein &amp; Lerner, 2003; 
        Mellers, Schwartz, Ho, &amp; Ritov, 1997). Losses are almost never pleasurable, but people believe losses hurt more when they are unexpected than when they are expected. Conversely, gains are almost always pleasurable, but are more pleasurable when they are unexpected than when they are expected. When people decide which potential losses to avoid and which potential gains to pursue, their decisions depend on predictions of their hedonic responses to those potential future gains and losses. Thus, an important question is whether affective forecasters are able to accurately predict the extent to which their hedonic responses to an outcome are influenced by the probability of its occurrence.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Various cognitive and motivational biases give rise to systematic errors in affective forecasting (e.g., 
        Eastwick, Finkel, Krishnamurti, &amp; Loewenstein, 2008; 
        Hsee &amp; Zhang, 2004; 
        Morewedge &amp; Buechel, 2013; 
        Morewedge, Gilbert, &amp; Wilson, 2005; 
        Nelson &amp; Meyvis, 2008; 
        Sieff, Dawes, &amp; Loewenstein, 1999; 
        Wilson &amp; Gilbert, 2003, 
        2005; 
        Wilson, Wheatley, Meyers, Gilbert, &amp; Axsom, 2000). Most experiments in this literature have examined the accuracy of forecasts for uncertain outcomes, but have not systematically measured or manipulated their probability of occurrence. In other words, this literature has not examined outcomes with precisely defined probabilities; nor has it precisely manipulated the probability of the forecasted outcomes. To illustrate, 
        Gilbert, Pinel, Wilson, Blumberg, and Wheatley (1998) asked assistant professors to forecast how happy they would feel if they received or were denied tenure. Obtaining tenure is an uncertain outcome for most professors, but the probability of receiving tenure presumably varies among different universities and for different professors. Given that the probability of receiving tenure was not measured or manipulated, it is unclear whether and how the probability of receiving tenure influenced forecasts and experiences, or how the probability influenced forecasting errors.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The present research addresses this central topic in emotion and decision-making research. Our central premise is that there is a difference in the affective intensity of the outcome when making an affective forecast for that outcome and when experiencing it. Hedonic experiences are typically more affectively intense than mental simulations of those experiences. We suggest that, because of this difference, experiencers devote a larger share of their limited attentional resources to the outcome (e.g., receiving tenure) and a smaller share to its probability specifications (e.g., the likelihood of receiving tenure) than do affective forecasters. Thus, probability specifications receive less weight and have less impact on experienced hedonic responses to an outcome than on affective forecasts for that outcome, even when both experiencers and forecasters know its probability specifications. As a result, experiencers generally exhibit less sensitivity to the probability specifications of an outcome than do affective forecasters, and this leads to errors in affective forecasting. We report the results of six experiments that provide support for our hypothesis and the underlying mechanism.</p><a id="psp-106-1-20-EMDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_8" title="Emotional Responses to Outcome Probabilities">Emotional Responses to Outcome Probabilities</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Theories of expected value (e.g., prospect theory) suggest that the utility of an outcome that may occur in the future (i.e., a prospect) should be positively correlated with both the desirability of the outcome and the probability of its occurrence (
        Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1979; 
        Laplace, 1814/1951). It is better to have a chance to win $100 than $1, for example, and to have a 99% chance of winning either amount than a 1% chance of winning either amount. In contrast, hedonic responses to an outcome that one is experiencing are believed to be positively correlated with the desirability of the outcome and inversely related to the probability of obtaining it (
        Kahneman &amp; Miller, 1986; 
        Mellers et al., 1997). It is more pleasurable to win $100 than $1, but it is presumably more pleasurable to have won either amount if one had a 1% chance of winning than if one had a 99% chance of winning.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">More generally, hedonic responses toward an outcome depend on the utility of the outcome itself, comparisons between it and counterfactual alternatives, and the likelihood of its occurrence (
        Mellers et al., 1997). Winning $5 is more pleasurable when the alternative was winning $3 than when the alternative was winning $7 (
        Kassam, Morewedge, Gilbert, &amp; Wilson, 2011), and receiving nothing is better when the alternative was losing $50 than when the alternative was winning $50 (
        Mellers et al., 1997). Furthermore, the less likely the actual outcome and the more likely a prominent counterfactual alternative, the more surprising is the outcome and the more intense is a person’s emotional reaction. For instance, when an outcome (e.g., winning $100) is better than its counterfactual alternative (e.g., winning $0), the larger the probability of its counterfactual alternative is, the more elated one will feel if one experiences it. Conversely, when an outcome (e.g., winning $100) is worse than its counterfactual alternative (e.g., winning $200), the larger the probability of its counterfactual alternative is, the more disappointed one will feel if one experiences it (
        Brandstätter, Kuehberger, &amp; Schneider, 2002; 
        Kahneman &amp; Miller, 1986; 
        Mellers et al., 1997).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Probability specifications influence both predicted and reported hedonic responses to outcomes (
        Brandstätter et al., 2002; 
        Mellers et al., 1997), but the accuracy of predictions regarding the impact of probability specifications has not been systematically examined. That is, whereas research has shown that probability specifications can influence both experienced and forecasted hedonic responses to outcomes, it is unclear how well people predict the influence of probability specifications on their hedonic responses to outcomes.

        Gilbert &amp; Wilson, 2007). Affective forecasters exhibit an impact bias, a tendency to overestimate the intensity and duration of their emotional reactions to a diverse array of future events, including winning money, receiving an HIV-positive test result, being denied tenure, the dissolution of a romantic relationship, the outcome of political elections, narrowly missing a train, and their team winning or losing a sporting event (
        Eastwick et al., 2008; 
        Gilbert, Morewedge, Risen, &amp; Wilson, 2004; 
        Gilbert et al., 1998; 
        Meyvis, Ratner, &amp; Levav, 2010; 
        Sieff et al., 1999; 
        Wilson et al., 2000).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Given that future events vary considerably with regard to their outcome specifications, such as their magnitude or probability of occurrence, and behavior is often determined by affective forecasts for future experiences (
        Hsee &amp; Hastie, 2006; 
        Morewedge &amp; Buechel, 2013), it is similarly important to understand whether and when affective forecasters can accurately predict the influence of such outcome specifications on their hedonic responses to the events.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Initial evidence suggests that affective forecasters and experiencers differ in their sensitivity to one kind of outcome specifications, namely, magnitude specifications. 
        Hsee and Zhang (2004), for example, found that people often predict that they will be more sensitive to the magnitude of outcomes than they actually are because predictions are often made in a joint evaluation mode (i.e., considering two or more outcomes simultaneously). Experiences, in contrast, occur in a single evaluation mode (i.e., realizing and experiencing a single outcome), with the latter making differences in magnitude less salient. 
        Morewedge, Gilbert, Keysar, Berkovits, and Wilson (2007) examined affective forecasters’ beliefs about the utility function for gains at small magnitudes in a single evaluation mode and found that affective forecasters underestimate the size of a gain necessary to change their hedonic experience. 
        Dunn and Ashton-James (2008) found that people exhibit a greater impact bias for larger than for smaller death toll tragedies. Similarly, 
        Gilbert, Lieberman, Morewedge, and Wilson (2004) showed that affective forecasters falsely predict that a less significant aversive event would cause shorter duration of pain than a more significant aversive event because they failed to consider that significant aversive events trigger psychological processes to attenuate them. Finally, 
        Gilbert, Morewedge, et al. (2004) demonstrated that affective forecasters overestimate the amount of regret they would experience if they missed an outcome by a small margin as opposed to a large margin.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">These findings demonstrate isolated cases in which affective forecasters and experiencers exhibit different sensitivity to the magnitude of future events (e.g., the amount of money won or number of lives lost). Given the extent to which outcomes vary with regards to specifications such as magnitude and probability, a more precise understanding of when and why outcome specifications differently influence affective forecasts and experiences is important and missing.</p><a id="psp-106-1-20-EKDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_19" title="Theoretical Model">Theoretical Model</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We propose a general theory of why and when affective forecasters and experiencers differ in their sensitivity to outcome specifications. The objective of the present research is to investigate whether affective forecasters are accurate in predicting how much probability specifications will impact hedonic responses to an outcome. Our theory posits that affective forecasters will overestimate how sensitive hedonic responses to an outcome will be to the probability of its occurrence.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">First, we propose that there is a difference in the affective intensity of an outcome when making an affective forecast for that outcome and when actually experiencing it. The experience of an outcome is vivid, concrete, and replete with emotional responses, including physiological reactions, arousal, facial expressions, and the cognitive appraisals of the experience (
        Myers, 2004). An affective forecast of an outcome, in contrast, is an imagined or a simulated reaction toward an abstract and hypothetical event. Although affective forecasters often overestimate the hedonic response that the outcome will evoke (
        Wilson &amp; Gilbert, 2003), the affective intensity of that outcome while simulating or “pre-feeling” it is usually less than the affective intensity of that outcome while experiencing it (
        Gilbert &amp; Wilson, 2007; 
        Loewenstein, 1996). Thus, the forecasted experience of an outcome is typically less affectively intense during judgment than is the actual corresponding experience of it (
        Loewenstein, Prelec, &amp; Shatto, 1998). When imagining how one would feel while skydiving, for example, one may overestimate how exciting it would be to skydive (as the impact bias suggests), but the mere simulation of that experience is not as affectively intense as is the actual experience of skydiving. In other words, when imagining skydiving, one might anticipate intense feelings of fear and an increased heart rate at the moment that one is jumping out of a plane, possibly triggering a fluttery feeling in the moment (
        Gilbert &amp; Wilson, 2007), but one is less likely to experience the same intensity of fear and increase in heart rate at the moment of imagination than at the moment when one is actually jumping out of that plane.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Second, we propose that this difference in the affective intensity of forecasts for an outcome and the corresponding experience leads to differences in attention to outcome specifications, such as outcome probability. People tend to pay more attention to affectively intense stimuli (
        Bradley, 2009; 
        Bradley, Houbova, Miccoli, Costa, &amp; Lang, 2011) than to neutral stimuli, and affectively intense experiences such as pain and consumption draw attention to the experience itself (
        Eccleston &amp; Crombez, 1999; 
        Morewedge, Gilbert, Myrseth, Kassam, &amp; Wilson, 2010; 
        Walker, 1971). Because attentional resources are limited (
        Broadbent, 1958; 
        Deutsch &amp; Deutsch, 1963), if more attention is devoted to the experienced outcome itself, then less attention is devoted to more peripheral and abstract specifications associated with the outcome (
        Bradley, Keil, &amp; Lang, 2012). Consequently, experiencers should typically devote less attention to the probability specifications of an outcome than should affective forecasters.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Finally, we suggest that this difference in the allocation of attention between affective forecasters and experiencers leads to differential sensitivity to outcome specifications, such as outcome probability. If probability specifications are to influence a person’s affective forecast or hedonic response to an experience, they have to be attended to, appraised, and incorporated into judgment (
        Bhatia, 2013; 
        Lazarus, 1991). Because experiencers attend less to probability specifications, we predict that probability specifications typically have less influence on hedonic responses to outcomes than on affective forecasts for those outcomes.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">As tentative support for our theory, research in the domain of risky gambles has shown that vivid or affect-rich outcomes, which elicit more intense affect in the judge, reduce sensitivity to probability specifications (
        Arkes, Herren, &amp; Isen, 1988; 
        Loewenstein, Weber, Hsee, &amp; Welch, 2001; 
        Rottenstreich &amp; Hsee, 2001; 
        Slovic, Finucane, Peters, &amp; MacGregor, 2004; 
        Sunstein, 2002), such that probability specifications seem to be largely neglected (
        Suter, Pachur, &amp; Hertwig, 2012). 
        Rottenstreich and Hsee (2001) found that the difference in the monetary amount participants demanded to opt out of a gamble in which they had a 1% or 99% chance of winning was smaller when the prize was a $500 trip to Europe (i.e., an affect-rich outcome) than when the prize was a $500 tuition remission (i.e., an affect-poor outcome). Our theory provides a process explanation of these results and makes predictions regarding the difference in sensitivity between affective forecasts and hedonic responses to the probability specifications of an outcome.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">It is important to note that our theory also predicts when forecasters and experiencers should be similarly sensitive to probability specifications. Forecasters should be similarly insensitive to probability specification as experiencers if their attention is diverted away from probability specifications to another task and if the forecasted outcome is sufficiently affectively intense while forecasting their response to it. Our theory also predicts that experiencers should be sensitive to probability specifications of an outcome if their attention is drawn toward its probability specifications.</p><a id="psp-106-1-20-EJDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_27" title="Overview">Overview</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We report six experiments that directly tested each of our predictions. Experiment 1 and Experiment 2 tested our main prediction that affective forecasters are more sensitive than experiencers to probability specifications for both positive and negative outcomes. Experiment 3 and Experiment 4 tested whether differences in the allocation of attention underlie this difference in sensitivity. Experiment 3 tested whether diverting the attention of forecasters away from probability specifications reduces their sensitivity to those specifications. Experiment 4 tested whether drawing attention to probability specifications increases the sensitivity of experiencers to those specifications. Experiment 5 and Experiment 6 tested our core theory that differences in the affective intensity of forecasts and experiences underlie the attention paid to and influence of probability specifications. Each tested whether differences in sensitivity to probability specifications between forecasters and experiencers were diminished when the forecasted outcome was made more affectively intense.</p><a id="psp-106-1-20-EIDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_30" title="Experiment 1">Experiment 1</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Experiment 1 tested the hypothesis that affective forecasters overestimate the extent to which probability specifications of a positive outcome will influence their hedonic response to that outcome.

            <em>I.</em> They were then shown two numbers (one even and one uneven) displayed under the two letters. In each of 30 trials, participants identified which of the two numbers was the even or odd number by pressing the corresponding letter key. Instructions at the top of the screen indicated whether they should identify the even or odd number.
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Participants then played a game of chance in which they picked one of 10 identical nutshells displayed on a computer screen. They were told that they would win $1 if they picked a nutshell containing a pearl and that they would not win anything ($0) if they picked a nutshell that was empty. Half of the participants were told that one of the 10 nutshells (i.e., 10%) contained a winning pearl. The other half were told that nine of the 10 nutshells (i.e., 90%) contained a winning pearl. In fact, the computer was programmed so that all nutshells would reveal a pearl, so that all participants won $1.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">All participants selected a nutshell and won $1. Participants in the high salience condition first recalled their probability of winning the gamble and stated it in an open-ended answer format (i.e., as a percent chance or odds). They then reported how happy they were that they had won $1 in the gamble on a 13-point scale with endpoints 
            <em>Very Unhappy</em> (1) and 
            <em>Very Happy</em> (13). Participants in the low salience condition did not recall their probability of winning. Rather, they simply reported how happy they were that they had won $1 in the gamble on the same 13-point scale after a 5-s delay.
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">As a manipulation check of the salience of probability specifications, the response time to identify the probability of winning the gamble was measured immediately after participants made their happiness ratings. Participants were first told to prepare for a reaction time task similar to the task that they had performed at the beginning of the experiment. After clicking a space bar to proceed to the task, they saw an instruction at the top of the screen asking them to identify their probability of winning as quickly as possible by pressing either the 
            <em>E</em> or 
            <em>I</em> key on their keyboard, with each of those keys associated with either 10% or 90%.

One alternative interpretation of the findings of Experiments 1 to 3 is that experiencers, as well as forecasters under high load, attend to probability specifications but do not have the ability to process such specifications. In other words, their attentional capacity is constrained to the extent that they cannot appraise and incorporate probability specifications into their evaluations.

Outcomes are typically more affectively intense when experiencing those outcomes than when forecasting those outcomes, which leads experiencers to devote a larger share of their attentional resources to those outcomes than do affective forecasters.

            <em>N</em> = 44) were randomly assigned to evaluate either a wrapped chocolate-chip cookie (presented in its original opaque wrapper) or an unwrapped chocolate-chip cookie (presented on top of its original wrapper) placed before them on a desk in a private cubicle. Participants first estimated the value of the cookie on an analog scale with endpoints 
            <em>$1</em> and 
            <em>$3.</em> Then, they rated how much they liked the cookie type (i.e., chocolate chip) on a 5-point scale with endpoints 
            <em>Dislike Extremely</em> (1) and 
            <em>Like Extremely</em> (5). Finally, participants evaluated the appeal of the cookie, its vividness, its affect richness, its desirability, how tempting it was, how much emotion it elicited, and how easy it was to imagine eating it on analog scales with endpoints 
            <em>Not at all</em> (1) and 
            <em>Very</em> (100).
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">A factor analysis of all these measures (using extraction criterion of eigenvalue &gt; 1) yielded two factors. One factor included the dimensions related to affect richness (i.e., appeal, vividness, affect richness, desirability, how tempting it was, how much emotion it elicited, ease of imagining eating it), whereas the second factor included the two remaining dimensions (i.e., the value estimate and liking of cookie type). Because the correlation between the value estimate and the liking of cookie type was low (
            <em>r</em> = −.10, 
            <em>p</em> = .51), these measures were not treated as a factor but as separate constructs, leaving affect richness as the only factor. The affect-richness items were averaged to an index of affect richness (α = .91). The affect-richness index, the value estimate, and the liking of cookie type were submitted to a 2 (wrapping: wrapped, unwrapped) × 3 (within-subject measures: affect richness, value, liking) mixed ANOVA. The analysis revealed a significant main effect of the within-subject measures, 
            <em>F</em>(2, 84) = 68.11, 
            <em>p</em> &lt; .001, η
            <sup>2</sup> = .60; a significant between-subject effect of wrapping,

            <em>p</em> &lt; .001, η
            <sup>2</sup> = .21. Simple effects revealed that the affect-richness index was higher when the cookie was unwrapped (
            <em>M</em> = 54.69, 
            <em>SD</em> = 25.60) than when the cookie was wrapped (
            <em>M</em> = 24.79, 
            <em>SD</em> = 34.16), 
            <em>F</em>(1, 42) = 10.79, 
            <em>p</em> = .002, η
            <sup>2</sup> = .20. The wrapping manipulation did not influence the value estimate or the reported liking of the cookie type (
            <em>F</em>s &lt; 1; see 
            Figure 5). The results of the pretest revealed that the unwrapped cookie was indeed perceived to be more affect-rich and that it evoked greater affective intensity than did the wrapped cookie, but the wrapping manipulation did not influence value estimates or how much participants liked the cookie.

Forecasters were sensitive to probability specifications when the reward was affect-poor but were insensitive to probability specifications when the reward was affect-rich. Experiencers were insensitive to probability specifications regardless of the affect richness of the reward. The results provide direct support for our proposition that differences in the affective intensity of the forecasted and experienced outcome underlie the difference in sensitivity to probability specifications between affective forecasters and experiencers.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The results of Experiment 5 rule out three potential alternative interpretations that could account for different sensitivity of affective forecasters and experiencers to probability specifications in the previous studies. First, the results rule out the alternative account that forecasters are more likely than experiencers to be influenced by lay beliefs about how probability influences happiness with an outcome. Erroneous lay beliefs have been shown to underlie some affective forecasting errors (e.g., 
          Novemsky &amp; Ratner, 2003; 
          Ratner, Kahn, &amp; Kahneman, 1999). A key difference between this alternative account and our theory is that our theory predicts that affect richness would influence the sensitivity of affective forecasters to probability specifications, as found in Experiment 5, whereas the erroneous-lay-belief account does not make such a prediction.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Second, given that forecasters in the affect-rich and affect-poor conditions made the same evaluative judgment but exhibited different sensitivity to probability specifications, the results also rule out the possibility that the differences in sensitivity result from differences in information processing used to make forecasts and report experiences (e.g., that affective forecasts involve more comparative judgment or a more deliberate processing style than the reporting of an experience; 
          Kahneman, 2011).
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Third, given that both groups of forecasters were asked the same question, the differences observed between the forecasters in the affect-rich and affect-poor conditions also rule out the interpretation that differences in sensitivity result from different conversational norms (e.g., that forecasters in previous studies were more likely to think that they were supposed to rely on and incorporate probability specifications in their judgment than experiencers; 
          Grice, 1975).
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">A fourth possible alternative explanation is that experiencers (and forecasters in the affect-rich conditions) in previous experiments had more information to make their judgments than forecasters had. For example, experiencers in Experiments 1 and 2 had information about how winning feels, whereas affective forecasters did not. Similarly, forecasters in the affect-rich condition in Experiment 5 saw the cookie without its wrapper, which might have provided them with more information about how it would taste than was provided to forecasters who saw the wrapped cookie. The availability of additional information might have made the experiencers (vs. the forecasters) in Experiments 1–2 and the forecasters in the affect-rich condition (vs. the affect-poor condition) in Experiment 5 ascribe less weight to probability specifications. We directly address this possibility in Experiment 6.</p><a id="psp-106-1-20-EBDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_166" title="Experiment 6">Experiment 6</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Experiment 6 manipulated the intensity of affect experienced during judgment while controlling for information about the experienced and forecasted outcome.

Delayed forecasters, who made their forecast when the affective intensity of the outcome was low, were more sensitive to its probability specifications than were experiencers, despite having had the experience that they were forecasting 3 minutes prior to making their forecast. Immediate forecasters, who made their forecast while the forecasted outcome was affectively intense, were as insensitive to probability specifications as were experiencers.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The results thus rule out the alternative account that differences in available information during judgment could explain the different sensitivity of affective forecasters and experiencers to probability specifications that was observed in previous experiments. In this experiment, delayed forecasters and experiencers had identical information about the outcome, and yet the delayed forecasters were more sensitive to its probability specifications than were experiencers. This suggests that affective forecasters’ increased sensitivity to probability specifications as compared to that of experiencers is not due to experiencers having more diagnostic information (i.e., knowing more about the outcome) or processing a greater amount of information, thus diluting the influence of probability specifications (
          Nisbett, Zukier, &amp; Lemley, 1981).
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Moreover, both the immediate forecasters and the delayed forecasters made forecasts for the same outcome, but they exhibited different sensitivity to probability specifications. The results of Experiment 6 therefore provide further evidence against the alternative explanations that were ruled out in Experiment 5; specifically, that differences in sensitivity to probability specifications result from differences in a reliance on lay beliefs, from differences in information processing during judgment, or from differences in conversational norms between affective forecasters and experiencers.</p><a id="psp-106-1-20-EADA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_188" title="General Discussion">General Discussion</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Affective forecasters overestimate how sensitive hedonic responses to an outcome are to the probability of its occurrence. We propose that differences in the affective intensity of the forecasted and experienced outcome lead to differences in attentional resources devoted to its probability specifications, which in turn lead to the observed differences in sensitivity to those specifications. The results of six experiments support our hypotheses.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Experiments 1 and 2 demonstrated the difference in sensitivity to probability specifications between affective forecasters and experiencers; this difference applies to both positive and negative outcomes and to different probability specifications. Experiments 3 and 4 showed that the allocation of attention toward probability specifications determines the sensitivity of affective forecasters and experiencers to probability specifications. Experiment 3 found that diverting attention away from probability specifications reduced the sensitivity of affective forecasters to probability specifications but did not influence the sensitivity of experiencers to these specifications. Experiment 4 revealed that drawing attention to probability specifications increased the sensitivity of experiencers to probability specifications.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Experiment 5 showed that increasing the affective intensity of an outcome by increasing the affect richness of the reward reduced the sensitivity of forecasters to its probability specifications but had no effect on the sensitivity of experiencers. Experiment 6 revealed that affective forecasters who had previously experienced an outcome were as insensitive to probability specifications as experiencers if they made their forecasts while the forecasted outcome was still affectively intense, but they were more sensitive than experiencers if they made their forecasts while the outcome was no longer affectively intense.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Because the affective intensity of the forecasted and experienced outcome was manipulated and information, type of judgment, and question wording were held constant, the results of Experiments 5 and 6 rule out several alternative explanations that could account for the differential sensitivity of affective forecasters and experiencers to probability specifications. In particular, sensitivity to probability specifications cannot be explained by an asymmetry in information available to forecasters and experiencers during hedonic evaluations, from differences in information processing used to make forecasts and report experiences, or from differential reliance on erroneous lay beliefs or conversational norms.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Although the present research has focused on the differential sensitivity to probability, our theory is likely to generalize to other outcome specifications. Similarly, although the probability specifications used in our experiments were always presented in an explicit, quantitative format and thus were objective and relatively easy to evaluate (
        Hsee, 1996), we believe that our findings would generalize to less objective and explicit likelihood formats, such as the perceived likelihood of missing a train, getting a promotion, or learning the outcome of a medical test. It would be beneficial for future research to test the generalizability of our findings to different outcome specifications and presentation formats.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The present research makes several contributions to our understanding of predicted and experienced utility as well as to our understanding of probability sensitivity. First, it identifies the differences in the intensity of affective responses evoked by mental simulations and corresponding hedonic experiences—and the accompanying differences in the allocation of attentional resources—as a source of errors in affective forecasting. In doing so, it complements research that has identified other origins of affective forecasting errors, such as immune neglect (
        Gilbert et al., 1998), focalism (
        Schkade &amp; Kahneman, 1998; 
        Wilson et al., 2000), and joint versus separate evaluation modes (
        Hsee &amp; Zhang, 2004). Additionally, it demonstrates a qualitatively different forecasting error than has been documented in previous research. Much of the affective forecasting research to date has focused on the accuracy of predicted emotional reactions toward a given event, such as a football game, the dissolution of a romantic relationship, or the outcome of a political election (
        Eastwick et al., 2008; 
        Gilbert et al., 1998; 
        Wilson et al., 2000). The present research examines the accuracy of predicted emotional reactions toward variations in outcome specifications associated with a given event. By showing that affective forecasters overestimate the influence of the probability specifications of an outcome on hedonic responses to that experience, the present research extends the sparse literature on the predicted and experienced utility from outcome specifications from magnitude (
        Dunn &amp; Ashton-James, 2008; 
        Hsee &amp; Zhang, 2004; 
        Morewedge et al., 2007) to probability specifications. Importantly, our research shows that mispredictions of sensitivity to outcome specifications do not only arise due to contextual factors, such as whether forecasts are made in a joint evaluation mode, whereas experiences take place in a single evaluation mode (
        Hsee &amp; Zhang, 2004). Mispredictions can also arise because of inherent differences in affective intensity of the forecasted and experienced outcomes, which result in differences in attention to the specifications of those outcomes.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Second, the present research aids the explanation and interpretation of related findings in the literature. It provides a process explanation for previously demonstrated differences in probability sensitivity for affect-rich versus affect-poor outcomes (
        Hsee &amp; Rottenstreich, 2004; 
        Loewenstein et al., 2001; 
        Mukherjee, 2010; 
        Rottenstreich &amp; Hsee, 2001; 
        Sunstein, 2002; 
        Suter et al., 2012) as well as differences in sensitivity to other outcome characteristics between affective forecasters and experiencers (
        Dunn &amp; Ashton-James, 2008; 
        Ebert &amp; Meyvis, 2011). The findings also further the understanding of the important role of attentional resources during hedonic evaluations. Whereas past research has shown that attentional processes influence the comparative value of an outcome (i.e., valuation and contrast effects) in affective forecasts and hedonic experiences (
        Kassam et al., 2011; 
        Morewedge et al., 2010), the present research provides evidence that attentional processes also determine the influence of outcome specifications on hedonic evaluations.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Third, the present research increases our ability to specify the circumstances under which probability specifications are likely to influence hedonic evaluations. Previous research found that probability specifications influenced predicted (
        Brandstätter et al., 2002) and experienced emotional responses (
        Mellers et al., 1997) when participants jointly evaluated the impact of different probabilities in a within-subject design. Consistent with 
        Brandstätter et al. (2002), we found that people predict that winning a reward will evoke greater happiness when the probability of winning that reward is small than when it is large, thus demonstrating that this effect occurs even when the probabilities are evaluated separately in a between-subjects design. Predicted sensitivity to probability specification in single evaluation mode disappears, however, when the forecasted outcome is affectively intense. Unlike 
        Mellers et al. (1997), we find no influence of probability specifications on experienced happiness unless attention is explicitly directed toward those specifications. This discrepancy is likely due to differences in sensitivity to quantitative information in joint versus separate evaluation mode (
        Hsee &amp; Zhang, 2004). Whereas participants in 
        Mellers et al. (1997) won multiple outcomes with varying probabilities in a within-subject design, making probability specifications salient, participants in the present research evaluated the probability of only a single outcome. This difference in evaluation mode and the resulting differences in the salience of probability specifications likely influenced the sensitivity of experiencers to those specifications (
        Hsee &amp; Zhang, 2004; see also 
        Rottenstreich &amp; Kivetz, 2006). Indeed, Experiment 4 found that drawing attention to probability specifications increased the sensitivity of experiencers to probability specifications. Taken together, probability specifications seem to have greater influence on forecasted happiness than experienced happiness unless they are made salient, such as when judgments are made in joint evaluation mode or when probability information is highlighted during judgment.
      </p><a id="psp-106-1-20-EBADA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Over- and Underestimation in Affective Forecasts</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Our theory implies that there is a stronger negative correlation between the probability specifications for an outcome and hedonic evaluations of that outcome for affective forecasters than for experiencers. It thus makes predictions for when affective forecasters will be more likely to overestimate or underestimate their hedonic response to an uncertain event. Forecasters should be more likely to overestimate the hedonic impact of low-probability outcomes and underestimate the hedonic impact of high-probability outcomes, which is generally consistent with the results of our experiments.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The idea that forecasters overestimate their response to low probability is also consistent with 
          Gilbert, Morewedge, et al. (2004), who found that affective forecasters were more likely to overestimate how much regret they would feel when missing a train or prize by a narrow margin than by a wide margin. Narrow margin misses are likely to be perceived as more unexpected than wide margin misses because they are more mutable. In other words, because it is easier to generate a counterfactual in which one did not miss a train or prize by a narrow margin as opposed to a wide margin, narrow margin outcomes should seem more unlikely (
          Kahneman &amp; Miller, 1986), leading to an overestimation of regret for narrow margin events.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The idea that forecasters underestimate their response to high probability events is also consistent with 
          Andrade and Van Boven’s (2010) finding that participants who rejected a gamble underestimated how pleased they would be upon learning that they would have lost had they chosen to play the gamble. In other words, affective forecasters in the experiment underestimated their hedonic response to learning that they avoided a negative outcome that they were certain to avoid (given that they had rejected the gamble). Similar to participants in our experiments, participants in Andrade and Van Boven (2010) who did not expect to experience a negative event (i.e., lose the gamble) underestimated how happy they would be to learn that they avoided that negative event.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We did find systematic errors in affective forecasting that are in line with our theory, but it is important to note that we did not observe a more general impact bias in the results of the six experiments. We believe that procedural idiosyncrasies in our experiments eliminating two major sources of the impact bias may explain why we did not consistently find an impact bias. Experiencers in our studies made their reports immediately upon learning an outcome and thus did not have as much time to adapt and rationalize the events as did experiencers in other affective forecasting studies (e.g., 
          Gilbert, Lieberman, et al., 2004). Furthermore, given the timing and the phrasing of our questions, the focus of both affective forecasters and experiencers was on the outcome of the gamble. Participants did not have intervening experiences between the forecasted and reported experience that could have diluted the influence of the focal event on hedonic evaluations or changed their interpretation of what they should report (
          Levine, Lench, Kaplan, &amp; Safer, 2012; 
          Schkade &amp; Kahneman, 1998; 
          Wilson et al., 2000).

Affective forecasters are more sensitive to the probability specifications of an outcome than are experiencers, leading to errors in affective forecasting. This difference appears to arise because a forecasted outcome is typically less affectively intense than the experienced outcome, which leads to a discrepancy in the attentional resources devoted to its probability specifications. The present research suggests that affective forecasters may be more accurate when the forecasted outcome is more affectively intense or when probability specifications are made salient. On a final, positive note, our results suggest that expected events, which are generally believed to be underwhelming, can bring surprising joy.</p><a id="psp-106-1-20-R" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_205" title="Footnotes">Footnotes</a></span><a id="fn1" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><sup>1</sup> Due to a programming error, the load manipulation check questions were not displayed to the participants on the first day of data collection.</p><a id="fn2" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><sup>2</sup> Correct completion was contingent on the passing of the Instructional Manipulation Test (IMT;
