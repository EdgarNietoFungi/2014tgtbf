Nongenetic factors, including major life events and experiences, explain approximately half of the variance in neuroticism. Conversely, neuroticism also predicts these life experiences. In this study, we aimed to quantify the reciprocal causation between neuroticism and life experiences and to gauge the magnitude and persistence of these associations. This longitudinal cohort study included 5 assessment waves over 16 years in a random sample of 296 Dutch participants (47% women) with a mean age of 34 years (SD = 12, range 16–63 years). Neuroticism was assessed with the Amsterdam Biographic Questionnaire. The experiences measured included positive and negative life events, long-term difficulties (LTDs), and change in life quality, all assessed by contextual rating procedures adapted from the Life Event and Difficulties Schedule. We fit structural equation models in Mplus. Results showed that neuroticism consistently predicted negative experiences, decreased life quality, and LTDs (β = 0.15 to 0.39), whereas effects on positive experiences were variable (β = 0.14). LTDs and deteriorated life quality each predicted small but persistent increases in neuroticism (β = 0.18), whereas improved life quality predicted small but persistent decreases (β = −0.13). This suggests set point change in neuroticism. Life event aggregates showed no persistent effects on the neuroticism set point. Neuroticism and life experiences showed persistent, bidirectional associations. Experience-driven changes in neuroticism lasted over a decade. Results support the corresponsive principle (reciprocal causation), suggesting a mixed model of change in neuroticism that distinguishes temporary changes in neuroticism from persistent changes in an individual’s neuroticism set point.

        John, Robins, &amp; Pervin, 2008). High neuroticism predicts most indices of psychopathology and physical health problems (
        Malouff, Thorsteinsson, &amp; Schutte, 2005; 
        Ormel et al., 2013; 
        Saulsman &amp; Page, 2004). Moreover, neuroticism predicts important life outcomes, such as occupational success, divorce, and mortality (
        Ozer &amp; Benet-Martínez, 2006; 
        Roberts, Kuncel, Shiner, Caspi, &amp; Goldberg, 2007). The total economic costs associated with neuroticism are more than twice that of all of the common mental disorders combined (
        Cuijpers et al., 2010). Insights into change in neuroticism and the determinants of change are therefore important (
        Lahey, 2009) and may lead to new interventions to target vulnerability to mental disorders rather than the manifestations of those disorders.

        Eysenck, 1951) uninfluenced by the environment (
        McCrae et al., 2000). Some theorists acknowledged that life events might evoke subtle short-term state fluctuations in neuroticism but hypothesized that levels would gravitate back to their immutable set point (
        Costa, Herbst, McCrae, &amp; Siegler, 2000; 
        Fleeson, 2001). However, accumulating evidence suggests that many individuals change in neuroticism over their lifespan (
        Caspi, Roberts, &amp; Shiner, 2005; 
        Roberts &amp; DelVecchio, 2000; 
        Specht, Egloff, &amp; Schmukle, 2011). For example, neuroticism shows a maturational mean-level change between ages 20 and 40 years of around a quarter of a standard deviation (
        <em>d</em> = 0.25) per decade (
        Bleidorn, Kandler, Riemann, Angleitner, &amp; Spinath, 2009; 
        Roberts, Walton, &amp; Viechtbauer, 2006). Moreover, a 40-year follow-up study of neuroticism during midlife (20 to 60 years) showed that 16% of individuals increased and 13% decreased by more than 0.50 (
        Soto &amp; John, 2012). Similarly, a study over 37 years, from midlife to old age (38 to 70 years), showed individual change in neuroticism of more than 1.00 for about a third of the women studied (
        Billstedt et al., 2014).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In sum, most individuals presumably remain relatively stable in their neuroticism set point, but reviewed evidence indicates developmental differences between individuals and the possibility for substantial change in neuroticism, provided that important changes in the environment also occur. There appears to be no point during the lifespan that neuroticism is immutable. This is known as the 
        <em>plasticity principle</em> (
        Caspi &amp; Shiner, 2011; 
        Roberts &amp; Wood, 2006). This suggests that the dispositional set point perspective is incomplete. We argue that experience-driven changes in neuroticism that last for years indicate a change in the set point rather than state fluctuations around a set point.
      </p><a id="psp-107-4-751-EHDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_10" title="Experiential Effects on Neuroticism">Experiential Effects on Neuroticism</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Studies of genetically identical twins, reared together and apart, indicate that a substantial part of the variance in neuroticism is due to nongenetic and nonfamilial factors, mainly experiences that were not shared by both twins (
        Keller, Coventry, Heath, &amp; Martin, 2005; 
        Lake, Eaves, Maes, Heath, &amp; Martin, 2000). The size of this nongenetic component of neuroticism increases with age (
        Laceulle, Ormel, Aggen, Neale, &amp; Kendler, 2013; 
        McCartney, Harris, &amp; Bernieri, 1990). Moreover, even the temporal stability of neuroticism shows a substantial experiential component (
        Laceulle et al., 2013; 
        Viken, Rose, Kaprio, &amp; Koskenvuo, 1994).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Prospective evidence indicates that neuroticism is influenced by life experiences, such as those involving romantic relationships (e.g., new partner or divorce; see 
        Mroczek &amp; Spiro, 2003), work (e.g., being fired or laid off, hired, or promoted; see 
        Sutin, Costa, Miech, &amp; Eaton, 2009), and illness or severe financial hardship (
        Middeldorp, Cath, Beem, Willemsen, &amp; Boomsma, 2008). However, it remains largely unknown which life events impact the neuroticism set point and how they affect it. Moreover, many changes in neuroticism may fade over time. In sum, recent work supports the plasticity principle and indicates that life experiences influence the neuroticism set point, although some experiences facilitate stability and others facilitate change (
        Fraley &amp; Roberts, 2005; 
        Laceulle et al., 2013). In the current study, we used five neuroticism assessments over 16 years to quantify the persistence of change in neuroticism driven by major life experiences.
      </p><a id="psp-107-4-751-EGDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_14" title="Reciprocal Causation">Reciprocal Causation</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The substantial nongenetic variance underlying neuroticism may reflect an individual’s proactive, reactive, and evocative modification of the surrounding environment through selection of spouses, friends, vocations, or hobbies, for example (
        Caspi &amp; Shiner, 2011; 
        Kendler &amp; Baker, 2007). It has long been believed that life events and experiences tend to shape personality development by intensifying the propensities that led individuals to those experiences in the first place. This snowballing effect, or reciprocal causation between experiences and personality (
        Caspi et al., 2005; 
        Lüdtke, Roberts, Trautwein, &amp; Nagy, 2011; 
        Middeldorp et al., 2008), is called the 
        <em>corresponsive principle</em>. The corresponsive principle suggests that mutually reinforcing feedback loops between the environment and personality shape personality development and stability.
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">It may even be that the neuroticism set point depends on the influence of genetically driven experiential effects (indirect genetic effects) rather than being directly determined by genetics (
        Nettle, 2007; 
        Roberts &amp; Jackson, 2008). The available evidence suggests that measures of the quality of an individual’s life experiences can be as stable as personality (
        Bronfenbrenner, 2005; 
        Kendler &amp; Baker, 2007). For example, individual differences in life experiences have a substantial genetic basis (
        Kendler &amp; Baker, 2007; 
        Power et al., 2013). Such genetic effects are partially mediated by neuroticism, in line with the corresponsive principle (
        Kandler, Bleidorn, Riemann, Angleitner, &amp; Spinath, 2012; 
        Kendler &amp; Baker, 2007; 
        Power et al., 2013). Many studies have shown that the incidence of negative (but not positive) major life events increases with increasing neuroticism (
        Lüdtke et al., 2011; 
        Middeldorp et al., 2008; 
        Specht et al., 2011), but, on average, individuals report more positive than negative life events (
        Berntsen, Rubin, &amp; Siegler, 2011) and positive events associate with decreases in neuroticism (
        Jeronimus, Ormel, Aleman, Penninx, &amp; Riese, 2013). The impact of negative experiences, however, seems more persistent than the impact of positive experiences (
        Baumeister, Bratslavsky, Finkenauer, &amp; Vohs, 2001).
      </p><a id="psp-107-4-751-EFDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_18" title="Hypotheses">Hypotheses</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We aimed to better define the rough contours of the corresponsive principle’s feedback system. Five neuroticism assessments over 16 years enabled us to gauge the magnitude and course of reciprocal causation between neuroticism and life experiences (mutually reinforcing associations). Uneven intervals between each assessment wave may also illuminate the temporal dynamics of experiential effects on neuroticism. We hypothesized that neuroticism levels are more predictive of variance in life experiences than vice versa (Hypothesis 1). More specifically, we hypothesized, in line with the corresponsive principle, that major negative life events tend to increase neuroticism (Hypothesis 2A) and that higher neuroticism scores predict more negative life events (Hypothesis 2B). This may spark a malignant cycle that cements increases in neuroticism, resulting in a lasting set point increase. Similarly, we hypothesized, again in line with the corresponsive principle, that major positive life events predict decreases in neuroticism (Hypothesis 3A) and that decreases in neuroticism predict positive life events (Hypothesis 3B). This may spark a benign cycle of positive reinforcement, resulting in a lasting set point decrease. Finally, on the basis of empirical work discussed above (e.g., 
        Baumeister et al., 2001; 
        Jeronimus et al., 2013; 
        Middeldorp et al., 2008), we hypothesized that increases in neuroticism driven by negative life events are less common than decreases in neuroticism driven by positive life events and that the positive effects are less persistent (Hypothesis 4). Thus, we argue that neuroticism is not immutable, that life experiences drive changes in neuroticism, and that experience-driven change in neuroticism that lasts for years indicates a change in the set point of neuroticism rather than state fluctuations around a set point.

        Ormel &amp; Rijsdijk, 2000) and the etiology and course of psychological distress (
        Ormel &amp; Wohlfarth, 1991; 
        Ranchor &amp; Sanderman, 1991). The use of life experience indices to predict neuroticism was not part of earlier work. In this study, we invested in a life event assessment based on the LEDS, still the gold standard in life event research (
        Dohrenwend, 2006; 
        Monroe, 2008). In the LEDS methodology, reviewers objectively rate the potential impact of specific events on individuals on the basis of the severity, duration, and ambiguity of the event; the context in which the event occurred; and the sociodemographic characteristics of the participant (
        Brown &amp; Harris, 1978).
      </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Interviews have limitations: They are costly and time consuming and may fail to capture embarrassing information (
        Grant, Compas, Thurm, McMahon, &amp; Gipson, 2004; 
        Monroe, 2008). Moreover, an individual’s life situation may change in a way that is not captured by a life event interview but that affects neuroticism. This study combines the following methods to minimize the weaknesses of each: (a) survey data of life events, (b) interview-based panel ratings of life events and difficulties, and (c) change in the participant’s environment or life situation.

          1) in 1970, 88 participants could not be followed up in the first two waves in 1975 (T
          2) and 1976 (T
          3; six died, five moved abroad, and 77 did not respond), leaving a final sample of 296 participants (77.1%; 
          <em>n</em> = 139, 47% women). At the next wave (T

          5) in 1986, 17 participants could not or did not complete follow-up measures (two died and 15 did not respond), whereas 230 participants responded. The total sample comprised 296 participants, of which 224 were interviewed five times over 16 years, whereas the other 72 participants missed T

          5, or both. The maximum likelihood analyses used in our study are based on all available data from all participants. At T
          1, the mean age of the participants was 34.3 years (
          <em>SD</em> = 11.8, range: 16–63 years); 26% were born between 1911 and 1925, 30% between 1926 and 1940, and 44% between 1941 and 1954. Comparison of the 224 responders and 72 nonresponders revealed no statistically significant differences in neuroticism, life events, or any of a broad range of sociodemographic-, distress-, and personality-related variables (
          Sanderman, 1988). However, attrition at all waves was related to age, because the rate of mortality was higher for older participants.

            5) using the eight best discriminating items (see Table S1 in the supplemental materials) of the Amsterdamse Biografische Vragenlijst (ABV; 
            Wilde, 1970). The ABV was the most popular Dutch neuroticism measure in the last quarter of the 20th century but lacks the breadth of modern neuroticism measures (e.g., NEO PI-R; 
            Costa &amp; McCrae, 1992). The content of the ABV is based on the Eysenck Personality Inventory (
            Eysenck &amp; Eysenck, 1975). Items were scored on a 3-point scale (
            <em>no, don’t know,</em> and 
            <em>yes</em>). In our study, on average, 6.7% of our participants (
            <em>n</em> = 20) answered 
            <em>don’t know</em> on an item. For these, we followed the principles of 
            Wilde’s (1970) manual, in which he stated that undecided individuals (those answering 
            <em>don’t know</em>) were most likely to score high on neuroticism. Therefore, we calculated scale scores as the sum of the eight items (
            <em>no</em> = 1, 
            <em>don’t know</em> = 2, and 
            <em>yes</em> = 2; theoretical scale range: 8–16). The average Cronbach’s alpha over the five waves was .85 (range: .74–.98).

            Brown &amp; Harris, 1978). The specific characteristics of each measure, however, varied across waves due to the varying time intervals between assessment waves and available funding, as outlined below.
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">At T
            2 (1975), we determined whether participants had experienced long-term difficulties (LTDs), irrespective of when the difficulties had arisen. The three inclusion criteria for LTDs were (a) sufficient stressfulness (impeding daily goals or plans), (b) duration of at least two months, and (c) presence of the difficulty in the 6 weeks prior to the T
            2 assessment. Often, but not necessarily, a LTD (e.g., unemployment for at least two months) had evolved from a negative life event (fired because of factory closure). Other examples of LTDs are marital discord, having a handicapped child, or serious chronic illness of a family member. Three independent and well-trained reviewers assigned contextual ratings of LTDs and life events on the basis of written interview materials in accordance with the methodology of 
            Brown and Harris (1978). They rated the impact of each event on the basis of the participant’s biography and broader social context, such as gender, age, and sociocultural background (the participants’ 
            <em>microsituation</em>). Reviewers may thus have rated a particular life event differently for different participants. For example, giving birth to a wanted child while financially stable was rated differently than giving birth to an unplanned child in poverty.
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Each reviewer also indicated whether LTDs were endogenous (brought about by the individual’s own behavior) or exogenous (independent of the individual’s own behavior). In cases of disagreement, we chose the position favored by the majority of reviewers. Reviewers rated the severity of each LTD (α = .92) on a 4-point scale (
            Brown &amp; Harris, 1978). We aggregated the mean ratings of severity into two indices, one for endogenous and one for exogenous LTDs.
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">At T
            3 (1976), we measured positive and negative life events that had occurred over the 14 months preceding the interview (since T
            2). Examples of negative life events include being fired or laid off, the end of a romantic relationship, divorce, fights with close friends, sickness, hospital admission, operations, accidents, or the death of a loved one. Examples of positive life events include starting a new job, starting a new romantic relationship, marriage, pregnancy, giving birth, earning a degree, moving to a new home, or beginning cohabitation. Three independent reviewers rated the pleasantness of each positive life event (α = .93) and long-term threat of each negative life event (α = .90) on a 4-point scale (
            Brown &amp; Harris, 1978), taking the participant’s microsituation into account. This means that closely related life events were counted together (e.g., loss of job and financial loss arising from that loss of job). We then determined the aggregate of the pleasantness scores of all positive life events and threat scores of all negative life events at T
            3.
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">At T
            4 (1984), less funding was available, which impeded the use of exactly the same methodology as at T
            2. Additionally, the 8-year interval between T
            3 and T
            4 required a somewhat different approach than was applied at T
            3, because life event assessments are less reliable over longer intervals. Also, the principal investigator at that time was focused on whether improvement versus deterioration of a person’s overall life circumstances (the life situation) had a corresponding impact on well-being. At T
            4, therefore, participants completed the Life Situation Schedule interview, which is used to collect information about a participant’s current life situation and any major life changes since T
            3. To collect this data, interviewers received information about the participant’s life situation at T
            3 but were kept ignorant of the participant’s mental state and psychological characteristics. The interviewers collected factual information on the participant’s microsituation (i.e., housing, neighborhood, financial situation, major interpersonal relationships, health status of significant others, stress and control in the work situation, amount of leisure time, and life events since T
            3;Sanderman, 1988). Three reviewers independently rated this information, comparing participants’ life situation at T
            3 with that at T
            4 using a 7-point scale to index change in life quality (1 = 
            <em>very much deteriorated</em>; 4 = 
            <em>neutral, neither improved nor deteriorated</em>; 7 = 
            <em>very much improved</em>). These ratings were recoded into two variables, scaled to reflect their inverse relationship with neuroticism: deteriorated life quality (a rating of 0–4 = 0, 5 = 1, 6 = 2, and 7 = 3) and improved life quality (a rating of 1 = 3, 2 = 2, 3 = 1, and 4–7 = 0).
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Finally, largely because of limited funding, T
            5 (1986) used a simplified life event measurement that assessed life events since T
            4 with a combination of a 95-item questionnaire with event ratings based on interviews that provided contextual and factual information about each event (
            Sanderman, 1988). The questions focused not only on the participant but also the participant’s household members; interactions with others; and experiences with health, work, children, and loss. Contextual questions sought to determine when the event had happened, what had happened, what the outcome of the event was, what the consequences were, and whether the event had positive and/or negative effects. Interviewers subsequently gathered additional information during a short telephone interview, mostly concerning the life events. Reviewers rated the long-term threat or pleasantness of life events on a 6-point scale via an (investigator-based) procedure modeled after the 
            Brown and Harris (1978) method. These scores were aggregated into positive and negative life event measures.

All neuroticism and life experience measures were nonnormally distributed (Shapiro–Wilk tests, all 
            <em>p</em>s &lt; .001; visual inspections showed positive skews or floor effects). Neuroticism was most skewed (
            <em>z</em> = 1.14, standard error [
            <em>SE</em>] = 0.14) and kurtotic (z = 0.52, 
            <em>SE</em> = 0.28) at T
            3. However, even the distributions for LTDs at T
            2 and positive and negative life events at T
            3 deviated too much from zero to assume normality (skewness ranged from 1.73 to 2.12, all 
            <em>SE</em>s = 0.14, and kurtosis ranged from 3.74 to 6.52, all

            <em>z</em> &gt; 3.29 is significant at 
            <em>p</em> &lt; .001). We observed floor effects for 20%–45% of the participants in most variables, rising as high as 77% for improved life quality at T
            4. Therefore, we tested mean differences in neuroticism using the Wilcoxon signed rank tests (
            Zimmerman, 2011), which indicated differences in mean score location (two-tailed Monte Carlo, 
            <em>k</em> = 10,000). We explored associations between variables using Spearman’s rho (
            Bishara &amp; Hittner, 2012). The multiple correlation squared of Spearman’s rho indicates proportion of variance in the ranks that two variables share, usually approximating the multiple correlation squared. To reduce familywise alpha inflation, we only interpreted correlations that were significant at 
            <em>p</em> &lt; .01. Finally, we heuristically derived the temporal effects of neuroticism and life events based on follow-up times. Thus, if the time between two neuroticism assessments was 5 years (e.g., N
            1 − N
            2), the interposed LTDs occurred, on average, 2.5 years before T
            2.

            <em>d</em> expresses differences in standard deviation units, which we indexed as small from 0.20 to 0.49, medium from 0.50 to 0.80, and large if greater than 0.80, using conversion formulas derived from 
            Borenstein, Hedges, Higgins, and Rothstein (2009). Finally, partial regression coefficients report the change in outcome per standard deviation change in a predictor. This enables comparison of predictors in a model.

            Muthén &amp; Muthén, 1999). SEM enables simultaneous modeling of several related regression relationships (e.g., neuroticism at T
            3 can be both dependent and independent in the same model) and estimation of measurement error as well. Approximately 20%–25% of the variance in our neuroticism measure was due to measurement error (
            Ormel &amp; Rijsdijk, 2000). Modeling neuroticism as a latent variable would adjust for this. A latent variable approach, however, is not possible for the experiential measures because many stressful life experiences are stochastically independent. We therefore applied a conservative observed-variable approach, which enables comparison of the magnitude and persistence of both experiential (life stress) and neuroticism effects. 
            Figure 1 shows our a priori baseline model. In this figure, horizontal paths quantify the strength of temporal associations in the model as β coefficients, while vertical paths reflect correlated change. Creating this baseline model allows us to test our hypotheses, and adjustments based on these tests enable us to construct a final model that best quantifies the mutually reinforcing relationship between neuroticism and life experiences.

Associations between subsequent neuroticism measures are henceforth called 
            <em>stability effects</em>. We distinguished four temporal dimensions for neuroticism effects on life experiences: 
            <em>direct neuroticism effects</em> on life experiences during a single interval (T
            <em>x</em>+1
            ) and 
            <em>delayed neuroticism effects</em> on life experiences over two (T
            <em>x</em>+2
            ), three (T
            <em>x</em>+3
            ), or four (T
            <em>x</em>+4
            ) measurement intervals. Notably, our model treated delayed neuroticism effects as unmediated by interposed neuroticism or life experiences measures: For example, paths calculating the delayed effect of neuroticism at T
            1 on change in life quality between T
            3 and T
            4 do not include T
            2 measurements as a mediating factor (Paths 37–38). However, as stated in the introduction, we do not expect delayed effects across two or more intervals and presume such long-term influences to be mediated (carried forward) by interposed neuroticism and life experience measures. Accordingly, we fixed delayed effects for three or four intervals at zero in our baseline model and, therefore, removed them from 
            Figure 1 (Path 37–48).
          </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We used secondary models to test these assumptions. If freely estimated delayed paths (T

            <em>x</em>+2−4
            ) at zero in the model caused no significant change in model fit. We also tested our assumption that exogenous LTDs between T
            1 and T
            2 are independent of neuroticism at T
            1. Deviance in model fit from the baseline model would indicate the importance of these neuroticism effects.

Concurrent effects are associations between different life experience measures from the same assessment wave. Additionally, we distinguished four temporal dimensions for experiential effects on neuroticism similar to the dimensions for neuroticism’s effects on experiences: 
            <em>direct experiential effects</em> on immediate neuroticism assessments (T
            <em>x</em>+1
            ) and 
            <em>delayed experiential effects,</em> or spillover, on later neuroticism assessments (T

            <em>delayed experiential effects</em> as unmediated by interposed neuroticism or life event measures in the baseline model, we actually expect long-term life event influences to be mediated (carried forward) by interposed neuroticism measures. Consequently, we fixed delayed paths of three or four intervals at zero in the baseline model and removed them from 
            Figure 1. Delayed experiential effects would, in theory, arise from LTDs to affect neuroticism at T
            3 (T

            5 (T
            <em>x</em>+3

Our results suggest five key observations: (a) neuroticism showed high temporal stability, (b) LTDs and deteriorated life quality predicted lasting increases in neuroticism, (c) improved life quality predicted lasting decreases in neuroticism, (d) life event aggregates had no persistent impact on neuroticism, and (e) neuroticism predicted experiences more consistently than experiences predicted change in neuroticism.</p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">These results support our hypothesis that neuroticism predicts life experiences better than life experiences predict neuroticism (Hypothesis 1), as indicated by more consistent neuroticism effects on life experiences and comparison of the largest observed effects for neuroticism versus life experiences (
        <em>d =</em> 0.96 vs. 
        <em>d =</em> 0.49, respectively). Yet although neuroticism consistently predicted negative experiences (negative life events, LTDs, and deteriorated life quality), its effects on positive experiences were ambiguous. Only positive life events at T
        5 were affected (which might be a chance effect). Effects of neuroticism on positive experiences are seldom reported and studied (see 
        Lüdtke et al., 2011). Our results suggest that decreases in neuroticism may potentially evoke positive experiences. This finding merits further research. Nevertheless, our observation that, of all possible reciprocal effects in our model, experiential effects on neuroticism were more numerous than vice versa (40% and 25%, respectively, of 20 possibilities in both directions) is at odds with our first hypothesis.
      </p><a id="psp-107-4-751-EDBDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Corresponsive Principle</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">This study aimed to clarify the rough contours of the corresponsive principle by examining several hypotheses (see the Hypotheses section above). Results indicate that LTDs and decreased quality of life increase the neuroticism set point (Hypothesis 2A) and that higher neuroticism scores predict more negative experiences (Hypothesis 2B), namely, LTDs, negative life events, and deteriorated life quality. We describe this reciprocity as a malignant cycle. Moreover, improved quality of life was associated with a decrease in the neuroticism set point (Hypothesis 3A) that, in turn, predicted more positive life events (Hypothesis 3B; although this was a variable effect). This latter finding suggests the possibility of a benign cycle (see also 
          Jeronimus et al., 2013), in line with the corresponsive principle, which is an interesting addition to the literature. The magnitude of increases in neuroticism because of LTDs and decreased quality of life was slightly larger than the magnitude of the decreases in neuroticism evoked by improved life quality (25%), and these changes were more persistent (13.5 vs. 6 years, respectively), in line with Hypothesis 4. Together, our results support the hypothesized valence asymmetry in experiential effects that has been observed numerous times before (
          Baumeister et al., 2001).
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Post hoc analyses showed that experiential measures were mainly unrelated to each other and, when related, were generally fully mediated by interposed neuroticism. However, we observed one exception. Endogenous LTDs at T
          2 forecast deteriorated life quality at T
          4, and neither neuroticism at T
          2 nor neuroticism at T
          3 mediated this effect. This argues against a narrow interpretation of the corresponsive principle, in which all effects are carried forward by interposed neuroticism. However, these findings require replication. The total impact on neuroticism of previous neuroticism-driven exposure to experiential effects (selection) was relatively small (
          <em>R</em><sup>2</sup> &lt; 7%), in accordance with most literature (
          Lüdtke, Trautwein, &amp; Husemann, 2009; 
          Riese et al., 2014; 
          van Os, Park, &amp; Jones, 2001). Nevertheless, these effects were persistent and may accumulate over time (reciprocal causation) as individuals seek, shape, and evoke life events and situations that match their personality, in line with the corresponsive principle (
          Caspi &amp; Shiner, 2011). This is also known as the Dickens–Flynn model (
          Beam &amp; Turkheimer, 2013). Thus, such feedback loops may become a substantial long-term influence on both neuroticism and life experiences.
        </p><a id="psp-107-4-751-ECBDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Mixed Model of Change in Neuroticism</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">This study’s key findings can be interpreted in terms of the mixed model of change in neuroticism, postulated by 
          Ormel, Riese, and Rosmalen (2012). The mixed model refers to the idea that experiential influences commonly induce temporary fluctuations around the neuroticism set point but that the set point itself may also change over time. We regard changes in neuroticism that persist for many years (&gt;13.5) to be indicative of neuroticism set point change. In line with the mixed model, aggregated life event measures showed no effect on the neuroticism set point in our model. Moreover, because neuroticism at T
          3 was assessed, on average, only 6 months after the positive and negative life events occurred, life event effects must reflect only short-term fluctuations. This agrees with the literature (
          Ormel et al., 2012; 
          Riese et al., 2014). Notably, this lack of impact cannot be explained by the assumption that life event aggregates tend to measure exogenous influences because exogenous LTDs impacted neuroticism at T
          4 over 3.5 years.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Only major life change (LTDs and changed life quality) appeared to influence the neuroticism set point, whereas aggregated life event measures evoked, at best, short-term fluctuations in neuroticism. This agrees with other literature reporting long-term negative associations between change in life quality and neuroticism (
          Jonassaint, Siegler, Barefoot, Edwards, &amp; Williams, 2011). These conclusions support the notion that patterns of increasing stability of neuroticism over time coincide with an increasingly stable environment, whereas change in neuroticism is associated with changes in the environment. This is known as the parallel-continuities hypothesis, in which personality is changed to cope with or adapt to new environmental conditions (
          Caspi &amp; Shiner, 2011). Further research should seek to determine the specific environmental conditions that influence the neuroticism set point and the mechanisms that drive that influence.

          <em>r</em> = .41), in line with the literature (
          Ormel et al., 2013). Part of this change undoubtedly reflects measurement error or new genetic expression, but twin studies suggest that most change must somehow reflect systematic experiential influences (

          Laceulle et al., 2013; 
          Riese et al., 2014). Major life events do not explain more than about 10% of the change in neuroticism, which suggests that most change in neuroticism must have other sources that remain largely unknown.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">More change in neuroticism may be explained if researchers map changes in the whole human socioecology, conceived by 
          Bronfenbrenner (2005) as a network of hierarchically nested, interconnected systems. At the basic level, individuals are embedded in microsystems such as their family of origin, friends or peer group, school, workplace, partner relationship (family of destination), and neighborhood. These microsystems form the social context in which individuals experience enduring patterned activities, social roles, and lasting interpersonal relationships (as partner, parent, worker, or friend). Within microsystems, individuals encounter sociocultural webs of expectations, commitments, and obligations, and the immediate interactions (proximal processes) are most profoundly affected by traits like neuroticism (
          Bronfenbrenner, 2005; 
          Nettle, 2007; 
          Roberts, Wood, &amp; Smith, 2005).
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In this article, we have emphasized that individuals shape and evoke the microsystems they inhabit (
          Caspi et al., 2005; 
          Caspi &amp; Shiner, 2011). Microsystems contain the proximal processes that drive the dynamic feedback loops through which genotypes express themselves as phenotypes (
          Bronfenbrenner, 2005; 
          Buss, 2011; 
          Ridley, 2003), for example, the work- and family-role-related influences that drive the maturational decrease in neuroticism between the ages of 25 and 45 years (
          Bleidorn et al., 2013; 
          Roberts &amp; Wood, 2006; 
          Roberts et al., 2005). Once enduring experiential effects alter proximal processes, it may spark autocatalytic amplification (which we have called malignant and benign cycles) that can result in a system shift (
          Cramer et al., 2012). With this system shift, a new neuroticism set point persists beyond the transient direct effects of the initial experience (
          Fraley &amp; Roberts, 2005; 
          Ormel et al., 2012; 
          Turkheimer &amp; Waldron, 2000).
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Once proximal processes within a system change, feedback loops may prevent regression to the old neuroticism set point, perhaps through secondary experiences (positive or negative) or spillover between microsystems. The system shift will persist if the new set point becomes anchored in newly structured proximal processes, such as change in social support, resources, identity, habits, or life events. Conceivably, each major flux in a microsystem may trigger a feedback loop and alter the network properties. Such effects have been observed after the formation of new romantic partner relationships or divorce (
          Mroczek &amp; Spiro, 2003), preterm childbirth (
          Kersting et al., 2004), and dismissal or promotion (
          Sutin et al., 2009), for example.
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The aggregate of all microsystems is called the mesosystem. The mesosystem changes via normative experiences, for example, entrance events (e.g., beginning school, work, relationships, or parenthood), exit events (e.g., divorce or dismissal), and accidents or disease (
          Bleidorn et al., 2013; 
          Bronfenbrenner, 2005). The enduring difficulties or changes in an individual’s quality of life that we studied may result in microsystem spillover and eventually affect the entire mesosystem and its many related proximal processes. For example, dismissal can lead to divorce, change of residence, or loss of social contacts. Experiential effects on the stability of neuroticism can be understood similarly (see the introduction). Individuals tend to shape their mesosystem in a way that promotes an increasing stability of the neuroticism set point with age (
          Caspi et al., 2005; 
          Fraley &amp; Roberts, 2005; 
          Roberts &amp; DelVecchio, 2000). Finally, different mesosystem characteristics and the unique combination of traits in each individual may explain individual differences in the rate of change in neuroticism (
          Billstedt et al., 2014; 
          Bleidorn et al., 2009; 
          Mroczek &amp; Spiro, 2003; 
          Small, Hertzog, Hultsch, &amp; Dixon, 2003; 
          Soto &amp; John, 2012). These developmental perspectives on individual variation could be tested with a substantial sample of individuals whose day-to-day experience and surroundings are measured in time series at different points throughout their life (
          Molenaar, 2008).
        </p><a id="psp-107-4-751-EABDA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Limitations and Future Directions</h4><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Our study results should be interpreted in light of the following strengths and limitations. Retrospective self-reports of life events inherently incorporate response components that may be influenced by current mental state, such as cognition, appraisal, interpretation, and recall (
          Dohrenwend, 2006; 
          Monroe, 2008; 
          Schwarz, 2007). Our panel ratings (see the Method section) address this bias by producing life event ratings independent of the respondent. Second, a maximum-likelihood application on multivariate data is, at best, only an approximation of reality, and “even the best possible model fit may not protect one from meaningless results” (
          Bentler &amp; Chou, 1987). We believe, however, that our sample came from a relevant population for evaluating the postulated hypothesis and that the final model contained sufficient degrees of freedom. Moreover, we interviewed 296 participants five times over 16 years and assessed life events, LTDs, and life situation change with interviews and panel ratings, the current gold standard (
          Dohrenwend, 2006; 
          Monroe, 2008). This methodology allowed for empirical testing of the corresponsive principle (reciprocal causation) that most studies are poorly suited to undertake. The small mean-level fluctuations we reported presumably reflect sociocultural events, random fluctuations, and measurement error (
          Roberts et al., 2006).
        </p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Finally, our use of different measures at different time periods (due to financial and methodological constraints) may have been confusing and perhaps accounts for part of the differences in effect sizes. However, we think it is unlikely that it has produced a major bias. Moreover, the use of different measures resulted in an unintended advantage as well: We now could compare the associations between different types of measures of change in a participant’s life situation and change in neuroticism.</p><a id="psp-107-4-751-EADA" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link_" href="#toc" id="hd_toc_104" title="Conclusion">Conclusion</a></span><br xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation" /><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The results of this study indicate that neuroticism, an enduring personality trait, consistently predicts negative experiences, whereas its effects on positive experiences are variable. Long-term difficulties and deteriorated life quality predicted small but persistent increases in neuroticism, whereas improved life quality predicted small long-term decreases in neuroticism. This suggests set point change. However, positive and negative life event aggregates had no effect on neuroticism. Together, these results align with the corresponsive principle, the plasticity principle, and the mixed model of neuroticism, which distinguishes temporary changes in neuroticism from persistent changes in an individual’s set point. Our results emphasize a mutually reinforcing relationship between phenotype and environment. Consequently, future studies of neuroticism should focus on the structure of the environment that individuals inhabit (their mesosystem topologies) and ideographically track the continuing effects of specific life-changing experiences or changes in quality of life over a lifetime (see 
        Friedman &amp; Martin, 2011). Finally, we hope that the potential we observed for a benign cycle helps to create prevention strategies to target the vulnerability to mental disorders inherent in neuroticism rather than treating the subsequent manifestations of those disorders.
